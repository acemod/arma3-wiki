|descr= Creates a sound source of the given type (type is the name of the subclass of [[ArmA:_CfgVehicles|CfgVehicles]] which is pointing to the sound defined in [[CfgSFX]]). The actual sound object created is of type {{hl|"#dynamicsound"}} and could be detected with [[allMissionObjects]]. If the markers array contains several marker names, the position of a random one is used, otherwise, the given position is used. The sound source is placed inside a circle with this position as its center and placement as its radius. Some of the vanilla classes pre-configured in {{arma3}}:
{{Columns|4|
* {{hl|"Sound_Alarm"}}
* {{hl|"Sound_Alarm2"}}
* {{hl|"Sound_BattlefieldExplosions"}}
* {{hl|"Sound_BattlefieldFirefight"}}

* {{hl|"Sound_Stream"}}
}}

Since {{arma3}} v1.70 it is possible to define sounds for use with [[createSoundSource]] in mission config. As mentioned earlier, the sounds needed for this command should be defined inside [[CfgVehicles]] class, which itself references [[CfgSFX]] class. If given class searched in main config and is not found, the search will continue in [[Description.ext|description.ext]] - see {{Link|#Example 3}}.<br>
Note that the sound created by [[createSoundSource]] will always be looping.
Also when [[CfgSFX]] sound definition contains more than 1 sound, there is no guarantee that the sound played will be the same on every PC in Multiplayer.

|pr= {{Feature|important|For some unknown reason if at the moment of command execution the player is in first person view and is inside a vehicle, the sound created is greatly attenuated.}}

|s1= [[createSoundSource]] [type, position, markers, placement]

|p1= type: [[String]] - [[CfgVehicles]] class

|p2= position:  [[Position#PositionAGL|PositionAGL]], [[Position#Introduction|Position2D]] or [[Object]] - desired placement position

|p3= markers: [[Array]] - if the markers array contains any markers, the position is randomly picked from array of given markers plus desired placement position. If any of the markers were given z coordinate with [[setMarkerPos]], the sound will also be created at given z coordinate

|p4= placement: [[Number]] - the sound is placed inside a circle with given position as center and placement as its radius

|r1= [[Object]]

	_alarm = createSoundSource ["Sound_Alarm", position player, [], 0]; // starts alarm
	sleep 10;
	deleteVehicle _alarm; // stops alarm

|x3= {{GVI|arma3|1.70}} Here is an example of suitable mission config definition:
