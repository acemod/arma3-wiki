id: KeyDown
description: |-
  * '''Use on:''' Display, Control
  * '''Fired on:''' Pressing any keyboard key. Fired before the [[#onKeyUp|{{hl|onKeyUp}}]] event.
  * '''Returns:''' Returns the display or control, the [[DIK_KeyCodes|keyboard code]] and the state of {{Controls|Shift}}, {{Controls|Ctrl}} and {{Controls|Alt}}.
  In {{arma3}}, in order to be able to intercept key events during gameplay, the Event Handler should be added to [[Arma_3:_IDD_List|Display 46]]:
  In general, one should never return [[true]] in the {{hl|onKeyDown}} EH, especially if it's added to [[Arma_3:_IDD_List|Display 46]] - otherwise all input is overridden and there is no way to do anything in the game anymore.
  {{Feature|warning|Pressing and holding key triggers 'autorepeat' action on Windows, which in turn will make this EH fire repeatedly as well.}}
