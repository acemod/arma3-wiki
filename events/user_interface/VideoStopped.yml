  {{Feature|warning|
  When using the event names via [[:Category:Command Group: GUI Control - Event_Handlers|GUI scripting commands]] (e.g [[ctrlAddEventHandler]], [[displayAddEventHandler]]), the prefix "on" in the name '''must be removed''' (e.g. {{hl|ButtonDown}} instead of {{hl|onButtonDown}})!

  == Event Parameters ==
  The Event Handlers receive parameters through the [[Magic Variables|magic variable]] <var>_this</var>. Each event passes a different set of parameters (listed above) in an array. The control or display that the event was assigned to is always found in <sqf inline>_this select 0</sqf>.
  == Scope ==
  {{GVI|arma1|1.00}} In {{arma1}}, most control-specific events ONLY work for controls and never for displays. The two exceptions being: {{hl|onKeyDown}} and {{hl|onKeyUp}}.<br>
  {{GVI|arma2|1.00}} Since {{arma2}}, most control-specific events work for both displays and controls.
  == Defining Events ==
  User Interface Event Handlers can be assigned in two ways: Via class property definitions or via [[:Category:Scripting Commands|scripting commands]].
