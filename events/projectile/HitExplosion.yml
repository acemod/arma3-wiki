description: |-
  ** position: [[Array]] format [[Position#PositionASL|PositionASL]] - position of impact
  ** vector: [[Array]] format [[Vector3D]] - vector that is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the surface struck. For example, if a wall was hit, vector would be pointing out of the wall at a 90 degree angle
  ** selection: [[String]] - Named selection of the object that was hit, in the FireGeometry LOD.
  ** radius: [[Number]] - radius (size) of component hit
  ** surface: [[String]] - surface type struck
