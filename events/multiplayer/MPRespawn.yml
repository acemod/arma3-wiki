id: MPRespawn
description: |-
  Triggered when a unit, it is assigned to, respawns. This EH does not work as one would expect MP EH should work like.
  It is only triggered on one machine where the unit it was assigned to is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]].
  The only difference between '''Respawn''' and '''MPRespawn''' is that '''MPRespawn''' can be assigned from anywhere while '''Respawn''' requires the unit to be local.<br><br>
  MPRespawn EH expects the EH code to return array in format of [[Position]], which will be used to place respawned unit at desired coordinates.<br>
  For example: <sqf inline>player addMPEventHandler ["MPRespawn", { [1234, 1234, 0] }];</sqf> will place player at [1234,1234,0] immediately on respawn.
