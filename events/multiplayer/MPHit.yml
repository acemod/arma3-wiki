id: MPHit
description: |-
  Triggered when the unit is hit/damaged. EH can be added on any machine and EH code will trigger globally on every connected client and server.
  This EH is clever enough to be triggered globally only once even if added on all clients or a single client that is then disconnected, EH will still trigger globally only once.
  Is ''not'' always triggered when unit is killed by a hit.
  Most of the time only the [[#Killed|killed]] event handler is triggered when a unit dies from a hit.
  The hit EH will not necessarily fire if only minor damage occurred (e.g. firing a bullet at a tank), even though the damage increased.
  Can also trigger several times for an explosion (direct and indirect damage). Does not fire when a unit is set to [[allowDamage]] [[false]].
  However it will fire with "HandleDamage" EH added alongside stopping unit from taking damage (<sqf inline>unit addEventHandler ["HandleDamage", { 0 }];</sqf>.
  Will not trigger once the unit is dead.
  Note: call a function from the MPHit EH code space rather than defining the full code in there directly.
  The reason is the code space will be transferred over network on each event activation - so keep the data as small as possible!
