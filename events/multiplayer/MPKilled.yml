id: MPKilled
description: |-
  Triggered when the unit is killed. EH can be added on any machine and EH code will trigger globally '''on every connected client and server'''.
  This EH has a safeguard measure so that even if it's added on all clients or a single client that is then disconnected, EH will still trigger globally only once per client.
