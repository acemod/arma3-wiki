id: Engine
description: |-
  Triggered when the engine of the unit is turned on/off.
  {{Feature|informative|
  Although the event is global, on clients (non-server) and applied to remote vehicles, it will fire only if the vehicle is closer than about 6 km from the camera.
  Should the vehicle be far away, it will fire as soon as the camera and vehicle are close enough together, alongside the [[isEngineOn]] flag change.
