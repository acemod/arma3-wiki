id: FiredNear
description: |-
  Triggered when a weapon is fired somewhere ''near'' the unit or vehicle. It is also triggered if the unit itself is firing.
  (Exception(s): the Throw weapon wont broadcast the FiredNear event).
  When "Manual Fire" is used, the ''gunner'' is [[objNull]] if gunner is not present or the ''gunner'' is not the one who fires.
  To check if "Manual Fire" is on, use [[isManualFire]]. The actual shot instigator could be retrieved with [[getShotParents]] command.
  {{GVI|arma3|1.30}} Works with thrown weapons.
