id: Dammaged
description: |-
  Triggered when the unit is damaged. In ArmA works with all vehicles not only men like in OFP.
  '''Notes:'''
  * The typo is "intentional": it is Da'''mm'''aged with two "m".
  * If simultaneous damage occured (e.g. via grenade) EH might be triggered several times.
  * The Dammaged EH will not necessarily fire if only minor damage occurred (e.g. firing a bullet at a tank), even though the damage increased.
