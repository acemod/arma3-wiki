id: ControlsShifted
description: |-
  Triggers when control of a vehicle is shifted (pilot->co-pilot, co-pilot->pilot), usually when user performs an [[action]] such as [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#TakeVehicleControl | TakeVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#SuspendVehicleControl | SuspendVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#UnlockVehicleControl | UnlockVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#LockVehicleControl | LockVehicleControl]], or when [[enableCopilot]] command is used. This event handler will always fire on the PC where [[action]] is triggered as well as where the vehicle is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] at the time. When control of the vehicle is shifted, the locality of the vehicle changes to the locality of the new controller. For example, if helicopter is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] to the server and co-pilot takes controls, the helicopter changes locality to co-pilot PC.
  This means that if "ControlsShifted" EH was added on both server and client, "Take Controls" action will trigger EH on both, client and server PC, but subsequent co-pilot "Release Controls" action will trigger only on co-pilot's PC, because vehicle will be local to co-pilot at this point. There is also a slightly better mission version of [[Arma 3: Mission Event Handlers#ControlsShifted | ControlsShifted]] event handler.
