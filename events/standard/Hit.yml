description: |-
  Triggered when the unit is hit/damaged.
  Is ''not'' always triggered when unit is killed by a hit.<br>
  Most of the time only the [[#Killed|killed]] event handler is triggered when a unit dies from a hit.<br>
  The hit EH will not necessarily fire if only minor damage occurred (e.g. firing a bullet at a tank), even though the damage increased.<br>
  Does not fire when a unit is set to allowDamage false.
