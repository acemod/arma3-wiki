id: HitPart
description: |-
  Runs when the object it was added to gets injured/damaged.
  It returns the position and component that was hit on the object within a nested array, this is because the model may have more than one selection name for the hit component
  (i.e. a single piece of geometry can be simultaneously part of multiple, overlapping named selections).
  While you can add "HitPart" handler to a remote unit, the respective [[addEventHandler]] command must be executed on the shooter's PC and will only fire on shooter's PC as well.
  The event will not fire if the shooter is not local, even if the target itself is local.
  Additionally, if the unit gets damaged by any means other than ammunition or explosions, such as fall damage and burning, "HitPart" will not fire.
  Because of this, this event handler is most suitable for when the shooter needs feedback on his shooting, such as target practicing or hitmarker creation.
  This EH returns array of sub-arrays [[...],[...], ... [...]]. Each sub-array contains data for the part that was hit as usually multiple parts are hit at the same time (see [[HitPart_Sample]]). The structure of each sub-array is listed below.
  -->In case of explosives that were planted by someone (e.g. satchel charges), that unit is returned
  {{Feature|informative|There is similar event handler that is attached to [[#HitPart_2|projectile]] instead of entity.}}
  {{Feature|informative|This event doesn't fire when miniscule explosive damage is dealt to target entity, but [[#Explosion|Explosion]] event will still fire.}}
params:
- name: target
  description: object that got injured/damaged
  type: Object
- name: shooter
  description: unit or vehicle that inflicted the damage. If injured by a vehicle collision, the target itself is returned, or in case of explosions, the [[objNull|null object]].<!--
