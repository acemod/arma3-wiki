id: SeatSwitchedMan
description: |-
  Triggered when unit changes seat within vehicle. EH returns both units switching seats.
  If switching seats with an empty seat, one of the returned units will be [[objNull]].
  The new position can be obtained with [[assignedVehicleRole]] <unit>. This EH must be assigned to a unit and not a vehicle.
  This EH is persistent and will be transferred to the new unit after respawn, but only if it was assigned where unit was local.
