id: FiredMan
description: |-
  Triggered when the unit fires a weapon. This EH must be attached to a soldier and unlike with "Fired" EH, it will fire regardless of whether the soldier is on foot or firing vehicle weapon.
  For [[remoteControl]]ed unit use "Fired" EH instead.
  {{Feature|warning|
  '''Special multiplayer behaviour:''' When added to a remote unit or vehicle, this EH will only fire if said entity is within range of the camera.
  That range is determined by the fired ammo's highest visibleFire and audibleFire config value.
  In case of units, muzzle attachment coefficients are applied too.
