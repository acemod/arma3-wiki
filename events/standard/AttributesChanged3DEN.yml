  * Changing the attributes by dragging, rotating or using one of the widgets
  * Changing and saving the attributes from within the attributes window
  * When attributes get changed using scripting commands such as [[set3DENAttributes]] or [[set3DENAttribute]]
  Unlike ''Dragged3DEN'' this event handler will not fire continuously but only when the attributes were changed '''and''' saved
