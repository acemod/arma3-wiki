id: Fired
description: |-
  Triggered when the unit fires a weapon.<br>
  This EH will not trigger if a unit fires out of a vehicle. For those cases an EH has to be attached to that particular vehicle.
  When "Manual Fire" is used, the ''gunner'' is [[objNull]] if gunner is not present or the ''gunner'' is not the one who fires.
  To check if "Manual Fire" is on, use [[isManualFire]]. The actual shot instigator could be retrieved with [[getShotParents]] command.<br>
  {{Feature|warning|
  '''Special multiplayer behaviour:''' When added to a remote unit or vehicle, this EH will only fire if said entity is within range of the camera.
  That range is determined by the fired ammo's highest visibleFire and audibleFire config value.
  In case of units, muzzle attachment coefficients are applied too.
