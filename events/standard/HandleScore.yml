id: HandleScore
description: |-
  Triggered when engine adds score to overall score of the unit, usually after a kill.
  If the EH code returns [[Nothing]] or [[true]], the default engine scoreboard update (score, vehicle kills, infantry kills, etc) is applied, if it returns [[false]], the engine update is cancelled. To add or modify score, use [[addScore]] and [[addScoreSide]] commands.
  For remote units like players, the event does not persist after respawn, and must be re-added to the new unit. <br><br>
  '''NOTE:''' MP only.
