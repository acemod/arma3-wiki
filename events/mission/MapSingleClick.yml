id: MapSingleClick
description: Executes when the player clicks anywhere on the main map. Stackable version of [[onMapSingleClick]] with the limitation that it does not have the ability to override the click (e.g. to prevent the player from placing the [[customWaypointPosition|custom waypoint]] with {{Controls|LShift|LMB}}). Since the introduction of <sqf inline>_thisArgs</sqf> for [[addMissionEventHandler]] in {{GVI|arma3|2.04}}, this EH also supports custom arguments (just like [[onMapSingleClick]]).
