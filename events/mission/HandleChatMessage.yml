id: HandleChatMessage
description: |-
  Fires when a message is received, before adding it to the chat feed. Fires clientside. The output message could be overridden:
  * Return [[true]] to block incoming chat message from being added to the chat feed.
  * Return [[String]] to replace the chat message content but not the sender name.
  * Return [[Array]] [from, text] to replace both the chat message content and the the sender's name.
  {{Feature|informative|Only the last added EH with override will be used to override the message.}}
  {{Feature|warning|Do not put any of the chat related script command such as [[systemChat]], [[sideChat]], etc in this EH code as it would naturally cause recursion and the game will freeze.}}
