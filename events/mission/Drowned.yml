id: Drowned
description: Runs when a vehicle gets drowned (the vehicle is submerged below 'maxFord' for longer than 'waterResistance'). This will cause engine damage and for some vehicles that will render engine unusable until the vehicle/engine is fully repared. Some vehicles can drown but would still be recoverable as they wouldn't be destroyed. The event handler will also fire when vehicle is removed from water, in which case 'drowned' param will change to [[false]]. To check if the engine was damaged by water use [[waterDamaged]] command.
