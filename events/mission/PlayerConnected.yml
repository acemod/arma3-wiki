id: PlayerConnected
description: |-
  Executes assigned code when client joins the mission in MP. Stackable version of [[onPlayerConnected]].
  ----
  If dedicated server was started without '-autoInit' option and this EH was created on server, on first GUI client this EH also fires against server, but after first client.
  In mission's {{hl|initServer.sqf}}:
  In RPT:
   2016/12/16, 15:39:09 "Client connected"
   2016/12/16, 15:39:09 [1.51343e+009,"7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1","longbow",false,3,"1513430065"]
   2016/12/16, 15:39:34  Mission id: 5071d20b183e9580d0ee4f95f413ca18681d6165
   2016/12/16, 15:39:34 "Client connected"
   2016/12/16, 15:39:34 [2,"","__SERVER__",false,2,"2"]
  That happens only for GUI clients, if HC client connects first, EH does not fire for server.<br>
  If dedicated server was started with -autoInit option, this EH does not fire against server, only for future clients, and all further clients appear to be JIP'ed.<br>
  Interesting moment for headless clients, for headless clients instead of [[getPlayerUID]], handler gets string like "HC12160", where '12160' is headless client process ID (matches HC's PID observed in windows task manager)
