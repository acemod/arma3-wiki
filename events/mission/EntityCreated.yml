id: EntityCreated
description: |-
  Triggered when an entity is created.
  {{Feature|informative|Unlike most event handlers, the argument is entity [[Object]] and not an array containing the entity. However, it is recommended to use [[params]] to make sure the code remains compatible in case the event arguments are expanded in the future.}}
  {{Feature|important|This event is called before variable namespace is copied to '''remote''' respawning entity, keep this in mind so your [[setVariable]]s are not overwritten in the next frame. [[#EntityRespawned|EntityRespawned]] always fires after variable namespace is copied to new entity regardless of locality.}}
