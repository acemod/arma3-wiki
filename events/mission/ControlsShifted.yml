id: ControlsShifted
description: Triggers when control of a vehicle is shifted (pilot->co-pilot, co-pilot->pilot), usually when user performs an [[action]] such as [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#TakeVehicleControl | TakeVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#SuspendVehicleControl | SuspendVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#UnlockVehicleControl | UnlockVehicleControl]], [[action/Arma_3_Actions_List#LockVehicleControl | LockVehicleControl]], or when [[enableCopilot]] command is used. This event handler will always fire on the PC where [[action]] is triggered as well as where the vehicle is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] at the time. When control of the vehicle is shifted, the locality of the vehicle changes to the locality of the new controller. Since Arma 3 v1.96 this EH is extended with additional params.
