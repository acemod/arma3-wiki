  Triggered when an entity is killed.

  It's worth noting that ''instigator'' param is [[objNull]] during road kill. To work around this issue try:
params:
- name: unit
  description: entity that was killed
  type: Object
- name: killer
  description: the killer (vehicle or person)
  type: Object
- name: instigator
  description: person who pulled the trigger
  type: Object
- name: useEffects
  description: same as ''useEffects'' in [[setDamage]] alt syntax
  type: Boolean
since:
  arma_3:
    major: 1
    minor: 56
argument_loc: Unspecified
effect_loc: Unspecified
examples:
- "addMissionEventHandler [\"EntityKilled\", {\n\tparams [\"_unit\", \"_killer\", \"_instigator\", \"_useEffects\"];\n}];"
- "addMissionEventHandler [\"EntityKilled\", {\n\tparams [\"_killed\", \"_killer\", \"_instigator\"];\n\tif (isNull _instigator) then { _instigator = UAVControl vehicle _killer select 0 }; // UAV/UGV player operated road kill\n\tif (isNull _instigator) then { _instigator = _killer }; // player driven vehicle road kill\n\thint format [\"Killed By %1\", name _instigator];\n}];"
