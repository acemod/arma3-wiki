id: HandleDisconnect
desc: |-
  Triggered when player disconnects from the game. Similar to [[onPlayerDisconnected]] event but can be stacked and contains the unit occupied by player before disconnect. Must be added on the server and triggers only on the server.
  '''Override''': if this EH code returns [[true]], the unit, previously occupied by player, gets transferred to the server, becomes AI and continues to live, even with [[Description.ext|description.ext]] param {{hl|disabledAI {{=}} 1;}}.
