{{Feature | Informative |
* ''fromObject'' has to be [[ropeCreate/transport | transport]] vehicle, [[alive]] with [[enableRopeAttach | rope attachment]] enabled, ''toObject'' has to be an entity, alive with [[enableRopeAttach | rope attachment]] enabled.
* {{hl|ropeEndType}} is defined in config under {{hl|"CfgNonAIVehicles" >> "RopeEnd"}}; see [[Arma 3: Ropes]]. Currently this is a hook that will be created on the end of the rope, and {{hl|ropeEndDownVector}} is its orientation, [0,0,-1] for example. The {{hl|"RopeEnd"}} is only shown when the rope is created object to object, it does not show on the open ended rope for some reason. There is currently no {{hl|"RopeStart"}}.
* The rope creation is limited to 63 segments.}}

|text= Doesn't work well for towing vehicles on the ground.<br>
Their wheels don't turn freely and have a LOT of friction. You'll most likely end up flipping the vehicle over if you try to tow it.<br><br>
Also note that ropes can be destroyed/cut by shooting at them.<br>
'''Edit:''' see [[setTowParent]] since {{GVI|arma3|2.06|size= 0.75}}!

{{Note

|text= Pay special attention to what is your '''fromObject''' and what is your '''toObject''' as this will have an impact on the physics of the rope.<br><br>
''For example:'' If you want to tow an Assault CRRC from a heavier Speedboat Minigun, attach two boats together with a rope.  If you drive the Speedboat Minigun and set the CRRC as the fromObject, the rope will have almost no elasticity and the CRRC will yank around as you tow it.  However, if you set the CRRC as the toObject, the rope will have more elasticity and will be a little friendlier for the CRRC when you are towing it.
