|text= When used on vehicles this will only return all magazines associated with a single turretPath (which one depends on the actual armament of the vehicle, usually the first armed turretPath or alternatively turretPath [-1]).<br>
If you want to get all turrets' magazines, use [[allTurrets]] and [[magazinesTurret]].

{{Note

|text= As Actium said, this function seems to extract data from:
<sqf>configFile >> "CfgVehicles" >> _the_vehicle_you_want >> "Turrets" >> "MainTurret">> "magazines"</sqf>
Some vehicles return an empty field {} because magazines are in straight in:
<sqf>configFile >> "CfgVehicles" >> _the_vehicle_you_want >> "magazines" // often dedicated to flares only</sqf>

This is the case of WY-55 Hellcat. This function returns an empty array.
