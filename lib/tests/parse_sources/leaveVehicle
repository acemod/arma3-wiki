|gr2= Groups

|descr= Ceases the using of the vehicle by a group and unassigns vehicle from the group.
If the argument is a single unit, the vehicle will be unassigned from unit's group.
After vehicle is unassigned from the group, each individual crew member then unassigned from the vehicle.<br>
<br>
In short the command could be hypothetically presented as:<br>
<sqf>leaveVehicle = un-addVehicle + unassignVehicle forEach crew</sqf>

However, to make it more reliable, it is best to move unit out of the vehicle manually with [[moveOut]] and force unassign the vehicle with [[unassignVehicle]].
