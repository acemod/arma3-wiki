<dd class="note">In '''OFP v1.96''', When a target is revealed to a unit, its knowsAbout rating is set to 1, unless it was already more than 1 in which case reveal does nothing. See [[knowsAbout]] for more details about knowsAbout ratings and limitations.</dd>

<dd class="note">Use reveal to allow client to ''see'' a [[createVehicle|created vehicle]] faster - the associated menu interaction will become available therefore, like the player has option to get in sooner.
<sqf>_tank = "M1A1" createVehicle (position player);
player reveal _tank;
// get in user actions become available instantly</sqf></dd>

<dd class="note">The same idea from Doolittle's note applies to beaming of units. If you [[setPos]] an unit or a player, reveal (all) nearby objects and vehicles to make the interaction possible a lot quicker.</dd>

<dd class="note">Revealing a targetUnit will also add it to [[nearTargets]] database of the given sourceUnit. The quality/detail level of the info depends on the [[knowsAbout]] value used with reveal. More detail in the [[nearTargets]] page.</dd>

<dd class="note">
Units that have been previously subjected to [[enableSimulation]] false; or [[enableSimulationGlobal]] false; may stay unrecognised for a long time even after simulation was re-enabled, returning [[objNull]] as [[cursorTarget]]. Force revealing units with [[reveal]] command usually solves the problem. For example:
<sqf>{player reveal _x} forEach allUnits;</sqf>
