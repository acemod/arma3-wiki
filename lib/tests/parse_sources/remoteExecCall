|descr= [[Scheduler|Unscheduled]] version of [[remoteExec]]. The only difference between [[remoteExec]] and [[remoteExecCall]] is that [[remoteExecCall]] will run '''functions''' in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]].
{{Feature|important|
The "Call" in [[remoteExecCall]] only means that the remote execution will take place in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]] and does '''not''' mean it will happen right away (see {{Link|#Example 3}}).}}
