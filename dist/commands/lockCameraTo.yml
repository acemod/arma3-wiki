name: lockCameraTo
description: |-
  Lock/Unlock stabilized camera to target. Works only on turrets which have optic mode selected with [[directionStabilizationEnabled|direction stabilization enabled]].

  {{Feature|informative|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.08}} the command also works with non-stabilized turrets (such as main turret of a tank). See {{Link|#Alternative_Syntax|syntax 2}}.}}

  {{Feature|informative|The command is local to the '''turret''' gunner, not the vehicle.}}
