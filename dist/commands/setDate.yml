name: setDate
description: Sets mission date and time. Players joining after mission start will get the current server [[date]] including the year.
multiplayer_note: |-
  {{Feature|arma3 |Clients' local date is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Join In Progress|automatically and periodically synchronised]] with the server date.<br>
  In order to change the date without waiting for automatic synchronisation, use remote execution: <sqf inline>[[2001,6,22,12,0]] remoteExec ["setDate"];</sqf>.}}
  {{Feature|warning|While the game creates February 29th in a leap year, it removes December 31st. For example <sqf inline>setDate [1980,12,31,12,0]</sqf> will result in game jumping to [1981,1,1,12,0] as 1980 is a leap year.}}
