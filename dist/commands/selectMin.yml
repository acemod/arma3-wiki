name: selectMin
description: "Returns the array element with [[min]]imum numerical value. Engine solution to [[BIS_fnc_lowestNum]] and [[BIS_fnc_findExtreme]]. Therefore it is expected that supplied array consists of [[Number]]s only.  [[Boolean]]s however are also supported and will be evaluated as [[Number]]s: [[true]] - 1, [[false]] - 0. [[nil]] value treated as 0. \n{{Feature | Warning | Other non [[Number]] elements (not recommended) will be evaluated as 0 and '''Bad conversion: scalar''' message will be logged into .[[rpt]].}}"

examples:
- _min = selectMin [1,2,3,4,5]; //1
- "// Same as, for example: \n_min = _a min _b min _c min _d;\n// Only faster:\n_min = selectMin [_a,_b,_c,_d];"
