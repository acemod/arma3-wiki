name: findIf
description: |-
  Searches for an element within array for which the code evaluates to true. Returns the zero-based index on success or -1 if not found.<br>
  Code on the right side of the command is evaluated for each element of the array, processed element can be referenced in code as [[Magic Variables#x|_x]].
  {{Feature|informative|[[findIf]] terminates as soon as it finds an element that fulfills the condition, thus it is more efficient than [[count]] in scenarios where a check for presence / absence of at least one element should be done (See {{Link|#Example 2}}).}}

examples:
- '[unit1, unit2, unit3] findIf {not alive _x}; // return index of the first dead unit)'
- "// two ways how to 'wait for all units to be dead':\nwaitUntil { [unit1, unit2, unit3] findIf { alive _x } == -1 };\t// fast, terminates as soon as it finds a living unit\nwaitUntil { { alive _x } count [unit1, unit2, unit3] == 0 };\t// slow, always goes through all array elements\n"
