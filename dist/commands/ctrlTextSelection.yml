name: ctrlTextSelection
description: "Returns edit control text selection in format [start, length, selectedText]. \n{{Feature|Informative|''length'' can be negative if text selection is made from right to left. Use [[abs]] with ''length'' or [[count]] with {{hl|selectedText}} if string length is required. ''start'' always indicates at what position in text the selection is started. The cursor position will always be at the end of the selection. So if selection is made from right to left the cursor position will be at the left end of the selection. In order to find cursor position add ''start'' and ''length'' together (see {{Link|#Example 3}}).}}"
