name: openMap
description: |-
  Opens or closes in-game map.{{Feature | Warning | If {{hl|forced}} param is set to [[true]] and map is set to open, when the map is opened it cannot be closed manually and the user can get stuck requiring the game restart. Make sure you provide scripted mechanics to resolve this, should you need to force the map. Useful when you wish to keep user for example on respawn screen, where they could still interact with the map but cannot enter the game until the time is up
  <br>
  Since Arma 3 v2.06.147984 the alternative syntax has the following functionality:
  * [[openMap]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[true]], [[false]]] - opens map normally
  * [[openMap]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[false]], [[false]]] - closes opened map normally
  * [[openMap]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[true]], [[true]]] - force opens map and keeps open (the user cannot close it on their own)
  ''New''
  * [[openMap]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[false]], [[true]]] - prevents map from opening, closes open map and forces it to stay close (the user cannot open it on their own)}}
