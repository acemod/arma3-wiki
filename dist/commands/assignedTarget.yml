description: |-
  Returns the target assigned to an unit or the vehicle's [[effectiveCommander]]. The target can be assigned by the group/vehicle/formation leader (as player via [[Arma 3 Field Manual - Commanding#Target_Assignment|quick command menu]] or [[Operation Flashpoint: Commander Guide#TARGET .282.29|"target" complex command menu]]).<br>
  To unassign the target use [[doWatch]] [[objNull]] or [[commandWatch]] [[objNull]] or as player and group leader order "no target" in the [[Operation Flashpoint: Commander Guide#TARGET .282.29|"target" complex command menu]].
  {{Feature | Informative |
  * This command does not return the target a unit is actually engaging ("attack unit"). For this information, see [[getAttackTarget]].
  * If a player is inside a vehicle as the [[effectiveCommander]], the vehicle's crew assignedTarget will always be [[objNull]].
