name: animateBay
description: |-
  Forces animation of bay to given state, -1 for reset to engine handling, can cause weapon inoperative, because weapon is released when bay state == 1.
  {{Feature|informative|While there is no getter to read the animation phase of the given bay, [[animationPhase]] command can be used with the individual bay door name from [[animationNames]] as a workaround.
  For example, for the UCAV Sentinel:
  <sqf>ucav animateBay [1, 1];
  // can be checked with
  ucav animationPhase "weapons_bay_l_1"
  // or
  ucav animationPhase "weapons_bay_l_2"
  </sqf>
