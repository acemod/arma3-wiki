name: setDriveOnPath
description: |-
  Sets the path to follow for AI driver. Note that [[unitReady]] will return [[true]] even if AI is still driving through the points.<br>
  Using any other ''move'' command (e.g <sqf inline>_vehicle move getPosATL _vehicle</sqf>) or [[doStop]] will stop the effect of this command.
  {{Feature|important|This command does '''not''' work on air vehicles and boats. Only land vehicles are compatible. (cars, tanks, APCs, etc.)}}
  {{Feature|informative|For the command to work properly, the unit must either be an [[createAgent|agent]], or in the case of normal AI, have been stopped using [[doStop]].}}
