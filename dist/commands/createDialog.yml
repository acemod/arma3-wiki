name: createDialog
description: |-
  Creates a dialog which is defined either in the mission's [[Description.ext|description.ext]], in the campaign's description.ext or in the global [[Resource.cpp/bin|resource.cpp]]. The given name has to be the class name used in one of these files. If another dialog is already opened, the desired dialog is created as a child dialog of the one already opened.

  {{Feature|informative|By default, displays created with [[createDisplay]] are rendered on top of dialogs created with [[createDialog]]. If ''forceOnTop'' is set to [[true]], the dialog will be rendered on top of displays.}}
