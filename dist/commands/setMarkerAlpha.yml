name: setMarkerAlpha
description: |-
  Sets the marker alpha. The marker is modified on all computers in a network session.
  <br>
  When alpha equals {{hl|1}}, the marker is visible, but if alpha equals {{hl|0}}, then the marker is invisible.
  <br>
  Alpha can be numbers and fractions.
  {{Feature|Informative|'''Multiplayer optimisation:''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''entire'' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}
