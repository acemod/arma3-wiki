      Name of the weapon or muzzle
      {{Feature|important|For weapons that have '''more than one muzzle''', you have to input the '''muzzleName''' and not the '''weaponName'''.
      * In {{ofp}}, in most cases, both names are the same. But check.
      * In {{arma1}} the weaponNames and muzzleNames are different.
      * For muzzle names see [[:Category:Weapons|CfgWeapons]].
