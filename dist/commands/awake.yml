name: awake
description: |-
  Wakes up sleeping PhysX object or puts a PhysX object to sleep. In 2.10 this command can be used on corpses of type {{hl|Man}} and has no effect on [[alive]] units. When unit gets killed it goes into ragdoll state for a short while, then the units get frozen and any simulation and collision is removed to save system resources. As a result, corpses do not react to their surrounding any more. Using this command will temporarily re-enable ragdoll state of a corpse to the same state it was when unit died. If this command is used in "enable/disable" sequence on a dead body, it gives the corpse a visible nudge (See example 3).

  {{Feature|informative|This command won't have lasting effect on vehicles as vehicles are actively simulated, but it works rather well on smaller PhysX enabled objects.}}
