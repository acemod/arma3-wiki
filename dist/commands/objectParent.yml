  Returns the parent of an object if said object is a proxy.

  {{Feature|important|
  Use [[objectParent]] instead of [[vehicle]] to get a soldier's vehicle.
  Apart from being faster it is also more reliable, as when used on dead [[crew]], [[vehicle]] command may surprisingly return the unit itself.
