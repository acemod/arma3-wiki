  Returns a list of all alive and dead entities of the given type or deriving from the given type. Units in vehicles are ignored with the primary syntax.
  {{Feature | Informative | '''Optimisation tip''': Keep number of types in both ''includeTypes'' and ''excludeTypes'' arrays to a minimum by possibly using parent/base classes.<br>If you have to use several types, arrange them in order so that the more common types go at the beginning of the array.}}
