  Delete a collection. As example, used with a soldier, it'll hide the ingame model.

  ''When targetting Arma 2 1.06 or newer, use [[hideObject]] instead. This function is a relic from dynamic building destruction development. It is left only for compatibility with scripts created before Arma 2 1.06, and its functionality may be changed or removed in the future.''
