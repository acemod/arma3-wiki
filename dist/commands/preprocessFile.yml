name: preprocessFile
description: |-
  Reads and processes the content of the specified file. Preprocessor is C-like, supports comments using {{hl|//}} or {{hl|/*}} and {{hl|*/}} and [[PreProcessor Commands]].
  Due to the hard-drive access this command executes and the lack of caching this command should not be used in time-critical script loops.
  {{Feature|warning|If the file you are loading is not prepared using UTF-8 encoding and contains some characters [[toArray | with codes]] > 127, they might convert incorrectly.}}
