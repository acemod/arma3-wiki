name: weaponDisassemblyEnabled
description: |-
  Returns if weapon disassembly is enabled. As disassembly can be enabled/disabled on both player and weapon, it might be necessary to check both.

  {{Feature|important|
  Beware that when the weapon disassembly is disabled on the player, it is tracking the unit itself.
  If the player leaves the server and another player joins into the same playable unit, they will not have the option to disassemble either.
