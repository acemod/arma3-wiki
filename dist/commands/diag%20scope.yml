name: diag scope
description: |-
  Returns script scope depth. When script is directly executed by the engine or a new script is added to the scheduler, the scope depth is 0.
  The examples of such execution are event handlers, [[spawn]], etc. [[isNil]] [[Code]] will also create a parent scope.
  Any use of [[call]] and such will stack execution creating child scopes and increasing scope depth.
