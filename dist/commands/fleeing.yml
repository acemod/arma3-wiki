description: |-
  Checks if a unit is fleeing.
  <br><br>
  Notes:
  * Fleeing only affects AI led groups.
  * Only the group as a whole can flee (or not).
  * The courage of the AI group is based on the group's leader [[Arma_3_AI_Skill#Sub-Skills|courage subskill]].
  * Each group has a max strength (summed "armor" of all infantry units - plus armor when inside vehicles).
  * If the group losses by injury/damage or death/destruction are higher than the max strength, multiplied by leader's courage or [[allowFleeing]] level , then the group will start fleeing.
  * As result primarily the AI flees to a nearby "supply point" (some friendly units - preferably with medic or engineer, or a vehicle with repair/ammo/fuel cargo). Alternatively it will try to find a safe position within a 600m radius from the initial waypoint (danger, distance, amount of cover positions are taken into account).
  * After the fleeing has been finished the group's initial strength is reset.
  * Fleeing units in [[combatMode]] red, will be set to yellow when fleeing to avoid engaging enemies while doing so.
  * While fleeing, the group leader will be set to green, to avoid giving engage or fire orders, unless in [[combatMode]] blue already. Also [[speedMode]] is set to full.
  * When reaching their flee point/destination, they will change to [[combatMode]] yellow and [[speedMode]] normal.
  * With [[allowFleeing]] one can make unit's flee earlier (or essentially never flee). Apply it, overrides the courage subskill influence.
