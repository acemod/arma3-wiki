name: configProperties
description: |-
  Returns an array of config entries which meet criteria in condition code. Command iterates through available classes and config properties for given config entry.
  If 3rd param is [[true]] the search also includes inherited properties. Current looked at config is stored in _x variable (similar to alternative [[count]] command implementation).
  Condition has to return [[true]] in order for the looked at property to be added to the resulting array. A bit slower than [[configClasses]] but allows to access inherited entries.
  {{Feature|Warning|The condition code passed to [[configProperties]] should only be used for '''simple filter expressions''' and nothing more.}}
  {{Feature|Informative|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.02}} the following conditions are optimised for performance:
  * {{hl|"true"}} (omitted condition)
  * {{hl|"isClass _x"}}
  * {{hl|"isClass _x &amp;&amp; (...)"}}
  }}
