name: effectiveCommander
description: Returns the effective commander of the vehicle. Effective commander is the player whom driver AI will listen to. So if in a tank there is a gunner and a commander and AI driver, if the [[effectiveCommander]] is gunner, then gunner pressing WASD will give AI orders to move. If gunner jumps out and then enters tank again, the [[effectiveCommander]] role most likely has changed to commander that remained in tank. Also the assignment seems to work on first come first served basis.
