name: endl
description: "Creates a string containing a line break, similar to [[lineBreak]] for [[text]]. The name is inspired by c++ std::endl ('''end''' '''l'''ine).\nThe command returns {{hl|\"\\r\\n\"}}, which contains control characters rather than printable characters:\n<sqf>\nhint str count \"\\r\\n\";\t// 4\nhint str count endl;\t// 2\n</sqf>\nThe line break works for [[diag_log]] and [[ctrlSetText]].\nIt does not work with the [[hint]] because [[hint]] interprets printable \"\\n\" as line break instead.\nAlternatively one can use [[toString]] command to get other characters."
