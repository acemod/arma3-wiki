name: forceFlagTexture
description: |-
  Forces a flag texture onto a flag carrier (unit, vehicle or flag pole).
  No flag holder is required. If {{hl|""}} is used as texture, the texture is removed.
  This will override regularly owned flags.
  This type of flag texture cannot be retrieved using [[flagTexture]], but [[getForcedFlagTexture]].

  {{Feature|important|Forced flag texture is an additional flag texture, which visually overrides original flag texture and therefore is very expensive to simulate, so use the functionality sparingly.}}
