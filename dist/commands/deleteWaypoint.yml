  Removes the specified waypoint.
  {{Feature|informative|
  * When a waypoint is deleted, all other [[group]] [[waypoints]] are immediately re-indexed. See {{Link|#Example 2}} for a deletion of all group's waypoints.
  * Deleting a group's [[currentWaypoint|current waypoint]] will ''not'' stop the group on its tracks.

- "Because waypoints get immediately re-indexed when one gets deleted, delete them from last to first:\n<sqf>\nprivate _group = group _unit;\nfor \"_i\" from (count waypoints _group - 1) to 0 step -1 do\n{\n\tdeleteWaypoint [_group, _i];\n};\n</sqf>\nor always delete the first one (if you want to delete them all)\n<sqf>\nprivate _group = group _unit;\nfor \"_i\" from 0 to (count waypoints _group - 1) do\n{\n\tdeleteWaypoint [_group, 0];\n};\n</sqf>\nor use [[forEachReversed]]:\n<sqf>\n{ deleteWaypoint _x } forEachReversed waypoints _group; // Arma 3 v2.14+ only\n"
