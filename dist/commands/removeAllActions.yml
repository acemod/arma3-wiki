  Removes all unit's user added actions.
  {{Feature|informative|This command's syntax was <sqf inline>unit removeAllActions number</sqf> from {{arma3}} v0.50 to v1.06.}}
  {{Feature|important|Usage of this command is usually a bad practice unless justified by the situation; removing all actions in order to remove all actions that ''one'' added is not a good method as a mod or another script could have added its own actions as well and see them removed. Instead, store the action id returned by [[addAction]] either in a script variable or using [[setVariable]].}}
