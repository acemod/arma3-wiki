description: "Creates vehicle crew corresponding to the provided vehicle's [[faction]]. If the vehicle is already occupied, the command will only create missing crew in the existing vehicle's group.<br>\nTo find out which crew will be created, use [[BIS_fnc_vehicleCrewTurrets]].\n  \n{{Feature|informative|This command:\n* {{GVI|arma3|1.26|size= 0.75}} creates a group if one is needed (otherwise uses <sqf inline>group vehicle</sqf>)\n* creates a driver (if the vehicle needs one - config {{hl|hasDriver}})\n* creates [[allTurrets|all non-FFV turrets]] gunners (if the turret needs one - config {{hl|hasGunner}} without {{hl|dontCreateAI}})\n* does not create cargo\n* does not [[addVehicle]] to the created crew in the same way this normally happens when crewed vehicle created in the editor. See [[BIS_fnc_spawnVehicle]] to spawn a crew-full vehicle with group addition.\n}}\n\n{{Feature|important|While a vehicle with a crew placed in editor will have all crew units of the [[rank]] {{hl|\"PRIVATE\"}}, this command will create the driver as {{hl|\"LIEUTENANT\"}} and all turret units as {{hl|\"SERGEANT\"}}.}}"
