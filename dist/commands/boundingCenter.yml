name: boundingCenter
description: Returns the position of the original (loaded) center of an object in model coordinates. Despite its name, it has nothing to do with [[boundingBox]] or [[boundingBoxReal]], it returns offset where {{hl|[0, 0, 0]}} was [[Object Builder]] / [[Oxygen 2]] when model was created.
