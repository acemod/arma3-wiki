name: selectRandomWeighted
description: "Returns a random element from the given array according to assigned weights. Engine solution to [[BIS_fnc_selectRandomWeighted]]. A few notes:\n* Negative weights are not supported\n* If an item's weight is 0, the item is ignored\n* The weights don't have to total to 1 \n* If numbers of items and weights do not match, the shortest array is used\n* A single array Syntax is slightly faster than Alt Syntax"
