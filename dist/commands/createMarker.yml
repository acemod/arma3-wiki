name: createMarker
description: |-
  Creates a new map marker at the given position. The marker will be created for every connected player as well as all JIP players. The marker name has to be unique; the command will be ignored if a marker with the given name already exists.

  {{Feature|important|The marker will be visible only once at least [[markerType]] has been defined:
  <sqf>_marker = createMarker ["markername", player]; // Not visible yet.
  _marker setMarkerType "hd_dot"; // Visible.</sqf>}}

  {{Feature|Informative|If the marker position is given in 3D format, the {{hl|z}}-coordinate is stored with the marker and will be used when the marker is passed to commands such as [[createVehicle]], [[createUnit]], [[createAgent]], [[createMine]] or [[setVehiclePosition]].<br>When a marker is manually placed in the editor, {{hl|z}} is always 0, which means the marker is placed on the ground. But when the player places a marker on the map in game, it is placed at sea level, so the {{hl|z}}-coordinate of that marker is <sqf inline>-getTerrainHeightASL markerPos "userMarker";</sqf>.}}
multiplayer_note: '{{Feature|Informative|''''''Multiplayer optimisation:'''''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''''entire'''' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}'
