  Make a unit perform an action. See [[:Category:Actions]] for action names and syntaxes.
  {{Feature | informative |
  * in singleplayer, when user Alt-Tabs the simulation is paused and so the action will also halt until user returns to the game. For example, <sqf inline>player action ["GetInDriver", car];</sqf> executed while user is Alt-Tabbed will result in the user seeing the action happening when he returns to the game screen. This doesn't happen in Multiplayer.
  * the alternative syntax creates a temporary Logic entity in place of ''unit''.

multiplayer_note: '{{Feature|important|The argument''s [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|locality]] is ''''''usually'''''' local, but some actions can take a global argument (e.g "Eject", "GetOut", "GetInXXXX", "MoveToXXXX"). See [[:Category:Actions]] for more details.}}'
