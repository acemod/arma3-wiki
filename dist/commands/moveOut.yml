name: moveOut
description: |-
  Moves the soldier out of the vehicle.
  <br><br>
  Notes:
  * Works for both AI and player entities
  * AI unit gets back in - unless is under player command or combined with other sqf commands ([[orderGetIn]] false, [[allowGetIn]] false or [[leaveVehicle]])
  * Respects the vehicle's lock state (same as [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]]) - unlike [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]]. It will work for [[player]] entities regardless though
  * Still executes when the vehicle is moving/flying (same as [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]]) - unlike [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]]
  * Without vehicle's position's get out animation - unlike [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action eject]], [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]]
  * Immediately - unlike [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action eject]], [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]]
  * Works also on dead units (same as [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] (but one after another)) - unlike [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]]
  * Does not work for UAV crew
  * Does not work for [[remoteControl]]led units
  * Works on [[setUnconscious|unconscious]] (same as [[Arma 3: Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] (but one after another)) - unlike [[doGetOut]], [[commandGetOut]] (unless AI under player command)
