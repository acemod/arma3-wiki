  Returns class name of currently used Head Mounted Display. Returns an empty string if the slot is empty.

  {{Feature|Informative|If [[hmd]] returns "" this doesn't immediately mean unit has no [[hmd]], some items like Special Helmet ("H_HelmetO_ViperSP_ghex_F") can have built-in [[hmd]] so you might want to check the type of [[headgear]] as well}}
