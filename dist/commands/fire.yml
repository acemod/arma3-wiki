description: |-
  Forces a unit to fire the given weapon.
  {{Feature | Informative | Just like with [[forceWeaponFire]] it is possible to pass remote unit as argument, but this could be unreliable. Considering this command might need to be used in combination with [[selectWeapon]], which takes only [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] arguments, it would make sense to execute the [[fire]] command where the unit is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] as well.}}
