description: "Gets the suppression value for the given unit. Returns varying [[Number]] between 0 and 1, or -1 if suppression is disabled ({{hl|[[disableAI]] \"SUPPRESSION\"}}) or the suppression value is not available. Suppression is not calculated for player entities and is always 0, unless it is set with [[setSuppression]]. In this case the return value is the set value. Before Arma 3 v1.92 this command could return [[nil]].<br><br>  \n{{Feature | important | The unit must not be [[objNull]], must be [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] and [[alive]]}}"
