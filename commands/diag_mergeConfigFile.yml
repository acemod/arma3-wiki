name: diag_mergeConfigFile
description: |-
  Updates config without restarting. Attributes and classes can not be deleted unless {{hl|[[Class Inheritance#delete|delete]]}} is used. Changes to the config are applied to all new entities, a mission restart is not necessarily required. Spawning the vehicle again or switching weapons works too. Since {{GVI|arma3|1.70}} CfgAmmo should be mergeable as well.
  {{Feature|warning|Merging a config with an [[PreProcessor_Commands#.23include|include]] statement, that points to a non existing file, will crash the game.}}
