description: |-
  When argument is [[Object]], the command returns the name given to a unit using the [[setIdentity]] instruction or selected randomly by the game engine if [[setIdentity]] has not been used on the unit.
  If used on vehicle, name of first crew member (in order commander, driver, gunner). If used on an object, "Error: No unit" is being returned.
multiplayer_note: '[[name]] returns [[profileName]], eventually suffixed by the server in the event of identical names, e.g {{hl|username}}/{{hl|username (2)}}.'
