name: flyInHeight
desc: |-
  Sets the flying altitude for aircraft relatively to the ground surface. Avoid too low altitudes, as helicopters and planes won't evade trees and obstacles on the ground. The default flying altitude is 100 meters. The minimum height is 20 meters.
  {{Feature|informative|Height measurement is relative to the pilot and can be approximated with <sqf inline>ASLToAGL eyePos driver _aircraft;</sqf>.}}
