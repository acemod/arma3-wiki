name: ctrlSetFade
desc: |-
  Sets wanted transparency for control animation. Requires [[ctrlCommit]] to commit changes. To hide or show a control instantly, use [[ctrlShow]].
  {{Feature|informative|
  If there are multiple (interactable) controls on top of each other but the top-most control is faded using <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 1</sqf>,
  this control will interfere with other controls that were defined earlier and in the exact same position.
  To counter that, the faded control '''must''' be disabled with [[ctrlEnable]].
  }}
problem_notes:
- |-
  Despite having <syntaxhighlight lang="cpp" inline>fade = 1;</syntaxhighlight> in a control's config, [[ctrlFade]] will still report a fade of 0 - resulting in <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 0</sqf> doing nothing.<br>
  To counter that, first use <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 1</sqf>, then <sqf inline>ctrlCommit 0</sqf> to apply it, and only then [[ctrlSetFade]] can be used as usual.
