name: ctrlSetFade
description: |-
  Sets wanted transparency for control animation. Requires [[ctrlCommit]] to commit changes. To hide or show a control instantly, use [[ctrlShow]].
  {{ Feature | Warning| Despite having <syntaxhighlight lang="cpp" inline>fade = 1;</syntaxhighlight> inside the config of a control, <sqf inline>ctrlFade</sqf> will '''still report a fade of 0'''.<br>
  Which results in <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 0</sqf> '''doing nothing'''.<br>
  To counter that, first use <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 1</sqf>, then <sqf inline>ctrlCommit 0</sqf> ( to instantly apply it ), and then you can use [[ctrlSetFade]] to set the fade to any value you wish.}}
  {{ Feature | Informative | If there are multiple (interact-able) controls on top of each other but the top-most is faded using <sqf inline>ctrlSetFade 1</sqf>, the top-most control will interfere with controls that were defined earlier and in the exact same position. To counter that, the faded control '''needs to be disabled''' with [[ctrlEnable]].}}
