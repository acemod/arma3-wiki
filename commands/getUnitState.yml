name: getUnitState
description: |-
  Returns current state of the given AI unit, which could be one of the following:
  * "WAIT" - another plan is needed (current partial plan was done or is not present)
  * "INIT" - operative planing should start, endpoint is set
  * "INITFAILED" - init failed because data are not ready
  * "BUSY" - operative plan ready and valid
  * "OK" - completed whole strategic plan
  * "DELAY" - repeat search, usually when failed
  * "CARGO" - unit is in vehicle cargo, no planning needed
  * "STOPPING" - unit is stopping (usually because of getin/getout request/landing)
  * "REPLAN" - we have a plan, but we would like to search a new one
  * "STOPPED" - unit is stopped, no planning needed (also landed. Different from [[stop]] command)
  * "PLANNING" - operative planning pending
