name: triggerArea
desc: |-
  Returns currently monitored trigger area. Since Arma 3 v1.60, the command returns 3rd dimension for the monitored area. If height is not set, the value for it would be -1.
  {{Feature | important | The trigger could be [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] or remote but the result returned by this command will be for the trigger area set up locally on the client that executed the command. See [[createTrigger]] for more info.}}
