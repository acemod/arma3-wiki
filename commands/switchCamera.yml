name: switchCamera
desc: |-
  Switch camera to given vehicle / camera. Mode is one of:
  * '''"INTERNAL"''': 1st person
  * '''"GUNNER"''': optics / sights
  * '''"EXTERNAL"''': 3rd person (inaccessible if difficulty settings do not allow for it)
  * '''"GROUP"''': group
  * '''"CARGO"''': same as "INTERNAL"

  If you switch to a unit in a vehicle, this command uses the correct turret.
  {{Feature|important|
  * Control over the unit is not given to the player. Use [[selectPlayer]] or a combination of [[switchCamera]] and [[remoteControl]] to achieve this.
  * Always [[switchCamera]] first (when needed) '''before''' using [[remoteControl]] as doing it after may lead to unpredictable results.
