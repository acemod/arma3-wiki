examples:
- |-
  Blackfish with no vehicle cargo loaded
  <sqf>private _result = blackfish canVehicleCargo offroad; // [true, true]
- |-
  Blackfish with one vehicle cargo called offroad already loaded
  <sqf>private _result = blackfish canVehicleCargo offroad; // [false, false]</sqf>
  Even if the Blackfish were empty, the offroad could not be loaded because it is already in a cargo space
- |-
  Blackfish with one vehicle cargo called offroad already loaded
  <sqf>private _result = blackfish canVehicleCargo offroad2; // [false, true]</sqf>
  offroad2 can't be loaded because there isn't enough space in the Blackfish, but if there were space offroad2 could be loaded into the Blackfish
