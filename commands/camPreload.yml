name: camPreload
description: Preloads the scene for the prepared camera with given timeout after which preloading is aborted. Max timeout is 30 seconds. Timeout of 0 means max timeout of 30 seconds as well. {{Feature|informative|This command will read prepared params set with [[camPrepareFOV]], [[camPreparePos]] and [[camPrepareTarget]], so no [[camCommitPrepared]] is necessary. If [[camPrepareFOV]] is not set, the default value is 1. If [[camPrepareTarget]] (for direction) and [[camPreparePos]] (for position) are not set, current [[direction]] and [[position]] of the camera are used. The prepared camera preload will preload main camera as well. [[cameraEffect]] is not necessary}}
