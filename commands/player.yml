description: A person object controlled by user. In Intros and Outros this isn't set by default and must be assigned.
multiplayer_note: |-
  In MP [[player]] is different on each computer and on dedicated server it is [[objNull]] by default ({{Link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v{{=}}JzgJe9sXAiU|unless scripted}}).
  When user is joining a dedicated server mission, at the moment of [[onPlayerConnected]] the [[player]] object is remote to the joining client, as the [[player]] unit is created on the server, but once control of the unit is passed to the user moments later, the [[player]] objects becomes and remains [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] to the client.

  See [[Multiplayer Scripting#General information about locality|Multiplayer Scripting's player topic]] for additional helpful information.
