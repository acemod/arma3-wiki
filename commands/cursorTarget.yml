name: cursorTarget
desc: |-
  Returns the target pointed at by the player (usually with cross-hairs). The target has to be known to the player to some degree ([[knowsAbout]] > 0). If target is completely unknown, command returns [[objNull]].<br><br>
  A valid target could belong to an enemy or a friendly side. Buildings are normally known to player and so are valid targets. Try [[nearTargets]] to see what else is considered a target.
  While friendly targets are usually known to the player, enemy targets can be totally unknown, especially if "auto-spotting" (or sometimes called "auto-reporting") is switched off. To check if auto-spotting is enabled: <sqf inline>difficultyEnabled "autospot"</sqf>.<br><br>
  [[cursorTarget]] also returns locked target for the duration of the lock even if there is another target under the cursor. As soon as missile is fired, [[cursorTarget]] switches to current known target under cursor or [[objNull]].
  Targeting ({{Controls|T}} in {{arma3}}) works regardless of the state of "auto-spotting".<br><br>
  Adding a target to the known list could be done with [[reveal]] command. When auto-spotting is enabled, zooming on the enemy target with cross-hairs usually reveals the target.
  As friendly targets are always known, zooming on friendly target could improve [[knowsAbout]] value.<br><br>
  [[Side Relations]] can also influence target knowledge. For example [[east]] target is unknown target for [[civilian]], but making them friends with [[setFriend]] instantly improves [[civilian]] knowledge of the [[east]].
