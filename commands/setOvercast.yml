name: setOvercast
description: |-
  Set overcast to given value smoothly during given time (in seconds). Zero time means immediate change.
  An overcast setting of zero means clear (sunny) weather, and one means storms and rain are very likely. Higher overcast values also result in higher [[wind]] speeds.
multiplayer_note: '''''''Pre {{arma3}}:'''''' Each client and the server can have differing overcast values. {{Feature|arma3|In {{arma3}} weather values are periodically synchronised with the server.}}'
