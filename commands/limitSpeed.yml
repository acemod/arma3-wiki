name: limitSpeed
description: Limit the speed of an AI-driven vehicle or AI person to given value. It has continuous effect and AI will not break through the speed limitation until one is contacted, engaged or regrouped.
problem_notes:
- Since {{GVI|tkoh|1.00|size= 0.75}} and as of {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}}, using any negative value on a helicopter will not reset the speed limit, but will force it to fly in reverse.
