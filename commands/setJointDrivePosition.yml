name: setJointDrivePosition
description: |-
  {{Wiki|WIP}} Requires that a linear "drive" has been configured in [[attachChild]].
  Sets the joints target position (relative to the joint's own position).
  The drive will then behave like a spring (springParameters are configured in the drive), trying to pull the child object to the desired position.
