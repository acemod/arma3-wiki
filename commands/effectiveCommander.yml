name: effectiveCommander
description: |-
  Returns the effective commander of the vehicle. Effective commander is the player whom driver AI will listen to.
  So if in a tank there is a gunner and a commander and AI driver, if the [[effectiveCommander]] is gunner, then gunner pressing {{Controls|W}} {{Controls|A}} {{Controls|S}} {{Controls|D}} will give AI orders to move.
  If gunner jumps out and then enters a tank again, the [[effectiveCommander]] role most likely has changed to commander that remained in tank. Also the assignment seems to work on first come first served basis.
