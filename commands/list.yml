name: list
desc: "List of units that would activate given [[Triggers|Trigger]].\n\nIt returns nothing before the simulation started, i.e. in (undelayed) init.sqf files. Returns a '''[[Array#Array properties|pointer]]''' to the trigger's list after the simulation started.<br>\nSince this is just a ''reference'' this means that the value in your local variable will change as the content of the trigger area changes.\nTo permanently copy the returned list to a different variable, use <sqf inline>_mylist = +(list triggerOne)</sqf>.\n\nThe second example can be used inside the trigger (in that case, no need to name your trigger).\n\nThe list returned for trigger of type \"Not present\" is the same as that returned for type \"present\". \n\n{{Feature|important|While the command can query any trigger, local or remote, the result will be only for the trigger condition set on the local client. See [[createTrigger]] for more info.}}"
