name: side
description: |-
  Returns the side of a unit, vehicle, object or location.
  * side of a renegade soldier is [[sideEnemy]]
  * side of an empty vehicle is [[civilian]]
  * side of a crewed vehicle is, if present, commander's > gunner's > driver's or > cargo's side, in this order
  * side of a captive or dead unit is [[civilian]]. Use <sqf inline>side group _unit</sqf> to get the underlying side (see {{Link|#Example 2}})
  * you can use [[playerSide]] to know the real player's side

  {{Feature|informative|
  Converting a side to string will '''not''' always return the side command text: e.g <sqf inline>str resistance; // returns "GUER"</sqf>.<br>
  See [[Side]] page to see the return value of all side commands.
