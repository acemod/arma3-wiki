examples:
- <sqf>_newVector = [1,2,3] vectorMultiply 3; // returns [3,6,9]</sqf>
- "<sqf>\n[1,2,3,4] vectorMultiply [1,2,3,4];\t// [1,4,9,16]\n[1,2,3,4] vectorMultiply 2;\t\t\t// [2,4,6,8]\n[1,2,3,4] vectorMultiply [2];\t\t// [2,2,3,4]\n[2] vectorMultiply [1,2,3,4];\t\t// [2,2,3,4]\n[1,2,3] vectorMultiply [1,2,3,4,5];\t// [1,4,9,4,5]\n</sqf>"
- "<sqf>\nprivate _eyePos = eyePos player;\nprivate _eyeDir = getCameraViewDirection player;\t// this is a normalized vector, i.e. its magnitude is 1\nprivate _100mFurther = _eyeDir vectorMultiply 100;\t// since _eyeDir is normalised (length = 1m), multiplying it by 100 means 100m in that direction\nprivate _lookPos = _eyePos vectorAdd _100mFurther;\t// the position where player is looking 100m ahead\n</sqf>"
