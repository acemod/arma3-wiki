name: vectorMultiply
desc: |-
  Multiplies an array of numbers by a scalar or another array of numbers.<br>
  {{Feature|GVI|arma3|2.14|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}} any count of numbers is valid, if one array is larger than the other, the remaining elements are inserted without change.<br>
  Before {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}}, the first argument had to be vector 3D, or {{GVI|arma3|2.00|size= 0.75}} 2D (Which still returned 3D result, with z coordinate defaulted to 0)}}
