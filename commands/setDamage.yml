      the entity that caused the damage. If the damage leads to the death of the unit, the killer will be used as the object that caused the kill.
      * it can be used to show "killed by player" in debriefing statistics and kill messages in the chat (if death messages are enabled).
      * it will alter the killer's [[rating]] as if the killer directly killed the unit
      * it will be listed as <sqf inline>_killer</sqf> parameter in the [[Arma 3: Event Handlers#Killed|Killed]] event handler
