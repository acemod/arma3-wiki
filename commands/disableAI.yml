name: disableAI
description: |-
  Disables parts of the AI behaviour to get a better control over the actions of a unit. If the unit changes locality, this command might need to be executed again at the new locality to maintain effect.

  {{Feature|warning|This command might cause unexpected behaviour when used on a player-controlled unit.}}
multiplayer_note: |-
  {{Feature|important|
  The locality of this command is peculiar: the disabling will be stored ''locally'' and will apply '''if''' the AI is local or becomes local (e.g taking the lead, driving, etc).
  If the AI changes locality again, that machine's AI setup will prevail.
