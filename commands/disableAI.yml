name: disableAI
description: |-
  Disables parts of the AI behaviour to get a better control over the actions of a unit. If the unit changes locality, this command might need to be executed again at the new locality to maintain effect.

  {{Feature|warning|This command might cause unexpected behaviour when used on a player-controlled unit.}}
multiplayer_note: |-
  {{Feature|important|
  The locality of this command is peculiar: the disabling will be stored ''locally'' and will apply '''if''' the AI is local or becomes local (e.g taking the lead, driving, etc).
  If the AI changes locality again, that machine's AI setup will prevail.

      ! Feature !! Description !! Since
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "all" {{!}}{{!}} Disables all features. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.66}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "AIMINGERROR" {{!}}{{!}} Prevents AI's aiming from being distracted by its shooting, moving, turning, reloading, hit, injury, fatigue, suppression or concealed / lost target. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.42}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "ANIM" {{!}}{{!}} Disables all animations of the unit. Completely freezes the unit, including breathing and blinking. No move command works until the unit is unfrozen. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|ofp|1.99}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "AUTOCOMBAT" {{!}}{{!}} Disables autonomous switching to "COMBAT" [[AI Behaviour]] when in [[Arma_2:_FSM_Danger_Causes|danger]]. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.56}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "AUTOTARGET" {{!}}{{!}} Essentially makes single units without a group "deaf". The unit still goes prone and combat ready if it hears gunfire. It will not turn around when gunfire comes from behind, but if an enemy walks in front of it it will target the enemy and fire as normal. '''Does not work for grouped units as the leader will assign targets to the units, effectively reenabling this feature.''' {{!}}{{!}} -
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "CHECKVISIBLE" {{!}}{{!}} Disables visibility raycasts. Useful in PvP missions where these raycasts are not needed. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.54}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "COVER" {{!}}{{!}} Disables usage of cover positions by the AI. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.56}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "FSM" {{!}}{{!}} Example {{!}} Disables the attached FSM scripts which are responsible for the AI behaviour. Enemies react slower to enemy fire and the enemy stops using hand signals. Disabling FSM can give the impression of untrained units as they react slower and are more disorganized compared to when FSM is enabled. {{!}}{{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma2oa|1.60}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "LIGHTS" {{!}}{{!}} Stops AI from operating vehicle headlights and collision lights. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.92}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "MINEDETECTION" {{!}}{{!}} Disable AI's mine detection. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.76}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "MOVE" {{!}}{{!}} This will stop units from turning and moving, including vehicles. Units will still change stance and fire at the enemy if the enemy happens to walk right in front of the barrel. Units will watch enemies that are in their line of sight, but will not turn their bodies to face the enemy, only their head. Works for grouped units as well. Good for staging units and holding them completely still. Movement can not be controlled via script either, this feature has to be reenabled for that. The unit will still be able to aim within its cone of fire. {{!}}{{!}} -
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "NVG" {{!}}{{!}} Stops AI from putting on NVGs (but not from taking them off). {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.92}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "PATH" {{!}}{{!}} Stops the AI's movement but not the target alignment. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.62}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "RADIOPROTOCOL" {{!}}{{!}} Stops AI from talking and texting while still being able to issue orders. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.96}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "SUPPRESSION" {{!}}{{!}} Prevents AI from being suppressed. See [[Arma 3: Suppression]]. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|1.42}}
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "TARGET" {{!}}{{!}} Prevents units from engaging targets. Units still move around for cover, but will not hunt down enemies. Works in groups as well. Excellent for keeping units inside bases or other areas without having them flank or engage anyone. They will still seek good cover if something is close by. {{!}}{{!}} -
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "TEAMSWITCH" {{!}}{{!}} This will disable AI unit when teamswitching. {{!}}{{!}} -
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "WEAPONAIM" {{!}}{{!}} Disables weapon aiming. {{!}}{{!}} -
      {{!}}-
      {{!}} "FIREWEAPON" {{!}}{{!}} Disables weapon firing. {{!}}{{!}} {{GVI|arma3|2.18}}
