name: animate
description: |-
  Activates given object animation. Animation is defined in CfgModels [[Model Config#Animations|animations]] class. Class names listed in CfgVehicles [[Model Config#AnimationSources|AnimationSources]] bound to "Proxy" controller can also be animated with [[animate]] command (see [[Arma 3: createVehicle/vehicles]]).
  {{Feature|arma3|
  * It is recommended that [[animateSource]] command is used instead of [[animate]] whenever is possible, as it is more efficient and optimised for multiplayer
  * Since {{arma3}} v1.58 animation names can be obtained with [[animationNames]]}}
  {{Feature|warning|Mixing [[animateSource]] command with [[animate]] command to animate the same part may produce some undefined behaviour.}}
