name: deleteVehicle
desc: |-
  Deletes an object. Only objects inserted in the mission editor and objects created during the game's progress can be deleted by this command. Terrain objects and players cannot be deleted.
  {{Feature|informative|The actual object deletion, when the object becomes [[objNull]], happens on the next frame after command execution, but there are some object modifications that happen immediately. For example if the object is a unit in a group, it immediately becomes groupless (<sqf inline>isNull group _unit; // true</sqf>).}}
problem_notes:
- '{{Feature|warning|Use [[deleteVehicleCrew]] to delete units that are in a vehicle! Do ''''''not'''''' use this command for a vehicle''s [[crew]] members as it may lead to all sorts of bugs and ghost objects left on the map.}}'
