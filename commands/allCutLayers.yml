name: allCutLayers
description: |-
  Returns all named layers used by [[cutRsc]], [[cutText]], [[cutObj]] or [[cutFadeOut]].
  The layer normally would be added on the first use of any of the aforementioned commands, however if a layer needs to be reserved it could be done like so:
  <sqf>private _layerNum = "TAG_myLayerName" cutFadeOut 0;</sqf>
