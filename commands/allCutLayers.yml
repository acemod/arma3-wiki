name: allCutLayers
desc: |-
  Returns all named layers used by [[cutRsc]], [[cutText]], [[cutObj]] or [[cutFadeOut]].
  The layer normally would be added on the first use of any of the aforementioned commands, however if a layer needs to be reserved it could be done like so:
  <sqf>private _layerNum = "TAG_myLayerName" cutFadeOut 0;</sqf>

    desc: The index of the layer name in the array corresponds to the layer number the cut effect will be displayed on. If no layers were defined, the return is <sqf inline>[""]</sqf>, because layer 0 is reserved for usage in cut commands without layer param or when the provided layer name is empty {{hl|""}}.
