name: leaveVehicle
desc: |-
  Ceases the using of the vehicle by a group and unassigns vehicle from the group.
  If the argument is a single unit, the vehicle will be unassigned from unit's group.
  After vehicle is unassigned from the group, each individual crew member then unassigned from the vehicle.<br>
  <br>
  In short the command could be hypothetically presented as:<br>
  <sqf>leaveVehicle = un-addVehicle + unassignVehicle forEach crew</sqf>

  However, to make it more reliable, it is best to move unit out of the vehicle manually with [[moveOut]] and force unassign the vehicle with [[unassignVehicle]].
