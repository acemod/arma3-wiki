desc: |-
  Composes a string containing other variables or other variable types. Converts any variable type to a string. If you want to convert a string back to a number, use [[parseNumber]].
  {{Feature | important | The output of this command is limited to ~8Kb. [[joinString]] on the other hand doesn't have such limit and is a bit faster.}}

  {{Feature|informative|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.20}} the maximum length of the string is {{hl|8388608}} characters. Additionally, two consecutive percent symbols will be formatted to a single percent symbol in the final string {{hl|(%% -> %)}}}}
