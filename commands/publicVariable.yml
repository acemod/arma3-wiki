name: publicVariable
desc: |-
  Reliably broadcasts [[missionNamespace]] variable and its '''current''' value to all computers (server/client).<br>
  Variables broadcast with [[publicVariable]] during a mission will be available to [[Multiplayer Scripting#Join In Progress|JIP]] clients with the value they held at the time.<br>
  Such variables are persistent and sent to the JIP client before the first batch of client-side [[Event Scripts]] (such as [[init.sqf]]) is run.
  {{Feature|important|Using [[publicVariable]] too frequently and/or with a lot of data can cause other aspects of the game to experience bandwidth problems.}}
