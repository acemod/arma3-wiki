name: animationPhase
desc: Returns the phase of the given animation on the given object. Animation can be scripted ([[animate]], [[animateSource]], [[animateDoor]]) or engine driven. Animation names for an object could be found out with [[animationNames]] command. When animation is rotation, like with "MainTurret" for example, the output is in radians, to convert to degrees use [[deg]] command.
multiplayer_note: In {{ofp}}, on dedicated servers, ''animationPhase'' will always return 0, no matter what the actual phase is.
