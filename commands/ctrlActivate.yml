name: ctrlActivate
description: Launches action attached to given (button based) control. Command ignores control disabled state. (Example 2). Main syntax command only triggers engine-based actions (cancel or ok codes) and will not trigger button related [[User_Interface_Event_Handlers|User Interface Event Handlers]] or [[buttonAction]], use the alternative syntax for this. "ButtonClick" UI event handler will also be triggered with the alternative syntax. Use [[isUIContext]] to distinguish between scripted activation and user activation.<br>
