description: |-
  Finish the mission.
  '''Mission saves are deleted'''. Use [[failMission]] if they should not be.
  {{Feature|arma3|To maintain {{arma3}} visual style, it is recommended to use [[BIS_fnc_endMission]] instead.}}
multiplayer_note: To end mission properly so that everyone goes to debriefing at the same time, this command should be executed on every machine (see {{Link|#Example 2}}).
