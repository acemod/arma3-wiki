name: allActiveTitleEffects
description: Returns a list of all layers that have currently active title effect. Numbers equal to or greater than 0 represent cut layers, where as -1 represents title layer (see [[Title Effect Type]]). Named layers are represented by their respective index.{{Feature|informative|Effects created with [[titleText]], [[titleRsc]] and [[titleObj]] commands do not have a numbered layer, so they are represented as -1 layer in the result. Effects created with [[cutText]], [[cutRsc]] and [[cutObj]] are created either on layer 0, if no layer is specified, or on the given layer, if the layer index is specified, so they are represented by the layer index.}}
