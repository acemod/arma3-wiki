name: setPos
description: |-
  Sets object position to format [[Position#PositionAGLS|PositionAGLS]] (over surface). The Z value is used to calculate the nearest surface below the provided position. If the surface is close, it uses the Z position of the surface. Otherwise, Z value becomes the offset from that surface.
  {{Feature| important | It is recommended to '''avoid''' this command when placing objects above other objects, due to the unpredictable behavior described above.}}
multiplayer_note: |-
  {{Feature|arma1|{{Name|arma1|short}} 1.00 to 1.06: this command has local effect, but some simulation types do synchronise their changes over the network whilst others do not.<br>
  So far, the only known simulation type that doesn't synchronise its position over the net is "static" ({{hl|c= simulation{{=}}"house"}}).}}
