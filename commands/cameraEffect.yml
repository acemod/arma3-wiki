name: cameraEffect
description: |-
  Sets the given effect on the given camera. If you want to switch the screen directly to the first-person, aiming, third-person or group view of an object, use [[switchCamera]] instead. The effect type "Terminate" is used to exit the current camera view and switch back to the player's view. Does not need [[camCommit]].
  <br><br>
  Since {{GVI|arma3|1.74}}, it is possible to terminate individual r2t source. For example:
  <sqf>
  cam cameraEffect ["terminate", "back", "rtt1"]; // would terminate "rtt1" r2t source
  cam cameraEffect ["terminate", "back"]; // would terminate all r2t sources
  </sqf>
  {{Feature|important|
  One cannot mix and match [[cameraEffect]] and can either have multiple [[r2t]] cameras or a single camera for the whole screen.
  If one needs a background stream overlayed with [[r2t]] streams, this could be achieved by creating an object and using [[switchCamera]] to switch to it for background image, while using [[cameraEffect]] for [[r2t]] overlay (see {{Link|#Example 4}}).

      position of the effect. Can be one of:
      {{Columns|5|
      * {{hl|"TOP"}}
      * {{hl|"LEFT"}}
      * {{hl|"RIGHT"}}
      * {{hl|"FRONT"}}

      * {{hl|"LEFT FRONT"}}
      * {{hl|"RIGHT FRONT"}}
      * {{hl|"LEFT BACK"}}
      * {{hl|"RIGHT BACK"}}
      * {{hl|"LEFT TOP"}}
      * {{hl|"RIGHT TOP"}}
      * {{hl|"FRONT TOP"}}
      * {{hl|"BACK TOP"}}
      * {{hl|"BOTTOM"}}
      }}
      These are usually used with "Fixed" and "FixedWithZoom" effect types. If not sure which position to use, set it to {{hl|"BACK"}}.
