name: selectLeader
description: |-
  Select the group's leader. Group locality can be checked with [[local]] command and group ownership with [[groupOwner]] command.

  {{Feature | important | An invalid combination can be provided to this command, e.g ''unitName'' '''not''' being part of ''group''. In that case:
  * ''unitName'' will be [[leader]] of ''group'', but will not be able to command them
  * if ''unitName'' is deleted or killed, [[leader]] of ''group'' will be [[objNull]] and will not automatically be reassigned.
