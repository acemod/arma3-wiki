  Sets a polyline marker's path.
  {{Feature|informative|'''Multiplayer optimisation:''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''entire'' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}

      Be aware that this command expects an array with a minimum array size of 4 and that the array count always needs to be dividable by 2 and return a whole number. Code:
      <sqf>count path >= 4 && count path mod 2 == 0; // true → valid path</sqf>
