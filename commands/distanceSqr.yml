name: distanceSqr
desc: |-
  Computes the {{Link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Squared_Euclidean_distance|squared distance}} between two objects or positions.
  This command is faster than {{Link|distance}} by saving a {{Link|sqrt|square root}} operation, useful for mass-checking distance without the need of the distance value itself.
