  Returns a distance in meters between [[Object]]s, [[Position]]s or [[Location]]s.
  {{Feature | important | If positions are supplied as arguments, the coordinates are treated as [[Position#PositionAGL|PositionAGL]]. If [[Position#Introduction|Position2D]] is supplied, z is assumed 0. If you need distance between two [[Position#Position3D|Position3D]] coordinates, use [[vectorDistance]].}}
