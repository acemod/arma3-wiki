name: throw
desc: |-
  Throws an exception. The exception is processed by first [[catch]] block. This command will terminate further execution of the code.

  {{Feature | important | Avoid using alternative shorthand syntax if you are planning on preparing your exception information dynamically, as it will have to be generated first regardless of the condition of the [[if]] statement before it, as shown in {{Link|#Example 3}}.}}
