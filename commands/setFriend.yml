name: setFriend
description: |-
  Sets how friendly a side is with another. The friendliness is set for one side, not for the other.  See also [[Side Relations]].

  {{Feature|arma3|Since {{arma3}} this command can be used mid-mission. Before that it was intended to be used on mission start only, as changing value during mission could cause unexpected errors in AI behaviour (especially for groups already knowing about "switched to enemy" groups).
