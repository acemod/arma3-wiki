name: allMissionObjects
desc: |-
  Returns all objects of the given type that are currently present in the mission. In some cases, the [[entities]] and [[allObjects]] commands are much faster alternatives to this command.<br>
  Some of the special types that can be detected with this command (and with [[nearestObject]]):
  * {{hl|""}} - returns everything, e.g. agents, bees, mosquitoes, footprints, armed mines, ...
  * {{hl|"all"}} - more restrictive than {{hl|""}}: no ambient insects, only agents such as rabbits and snakes, no footprints, tracks, no armed mines
  * {{hl|"#slop"}} - blood drops
  * {{hl|"#mark"}} - unit footprints
  * {{hl|"#track"}} - vehicle tracks
  * {{hl|"#crater"}} - explosion craters on the ground
  * {{hl|"#crateronvehicle"}} - bullet marks on vehicles
  * {{hl|"#explosion"}} - explosions
  * {{hl|"#objectdestructed"}} - building, tree or bush destruction
  * {{hl|"#soundonvehicle"}} - sounds created with [[say3D]] for example
  * {{hl|"#dynamicsound"}} - sound sources created using [[createSoundSource]]
  * {{hl|"EmptyDetector"}} - all [[Trigger]]s
  * {{hl|"Logic"}} - all game logics
  {{Feature|important|This command is quite performance heavy. Use with caution!}}
