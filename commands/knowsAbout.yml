name: knowsAbout
description: |-
  Checks if a group or a side knows about target.
  * Enemy knowledge is instantly shared among the group units
  * Units in the same group always perfectly know about each others
  * AI knowledge cannot check beyond current [[viewDistance]] and it resets to zero as soon as the target's distance is over it<br>Note: neither fog nor daylight affect this behaviour
  * Losing sight of a target for more than 120 seconds resets its [[knowsAbout]] to zero as well
  * '''Magic number''' is the value that must be reached for a unit to shoot at an enemy (used by "Detected by" triggers as well):
