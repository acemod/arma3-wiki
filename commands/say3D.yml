name: say3D
desc: |-
  Lets an object say given sound in 3D space.
  This allows broadcasting of positional music or sound from a source, without having to script a fade sound or music command.
  Compare this with [[say2D]] which will always play a sound at the location of the player after he has been in the vicinity of a broadcasting sound.
  Sound is defined in {{Link|Description.ext#CfgSounds|"CfgSounds"}} of the [[Description.ext]] or main config.

  {{Feature|informative|
  * an object can only "say" '''one''' sound at a time
  * in order to stop a [[say3D]] sound:
  ** delete the returned '''sound source''' with [[deleteVehicle]], or
  ** kill the '''sound source''' with e.g [[setDamage]].
  * prior to {{GVI|arma3|2.00}}, the '''sound source''' object was not returned by the command, so the '''from''' object had to be deleted instead (see Examples [[#Example 2|2]] and [[#Example 3|3]]).
  * forcing the speed of sound simulation:
  ** may delay the queued sound to play right after the previous sound, even if the second sound does not simulate sound delay (e.g sound 1 plays with a 5s delay, ends, ''then'' sound 2 plays)
  ** if the queued sound uses speed of sound simulation, it will be delayed from the end of the first sound (they will not follow "as expected")
  ** makes the ''offset'' parameter ignored.

  {{Feature|arma3|In earlier {{arma3}} versions, the sound created was greatly attenuated if the player was in first person view inside a vehicle at the moment of execution.}}
