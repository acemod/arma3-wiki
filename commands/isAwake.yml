name: isAwake
description: |-
  Returns resting state of a PhysX (EPE) object. Some EPE objects are deliberately put to sleep by the engine to save resources.
  This command returns [[true]] when object is simulating and [[false]] when it is put to sleep. With units of type {{hl|Man}} the behaviour is slightly different.
  As units never get put to sleep, the command outputs ragdoll state of a unit instead. There are 6 states for the output of the command:
  * EPE object is simulating - [[true]]
  * EPE object is put to sleep - [[false]]
  * Unit is [[alive]], ragdoll is active - [[false]]
  * Unit is [[alive]], ragdoll is NOT active - [[true]]
  * {{GVI|arma3|2.10|size= 0.75}} Unit is NOT [[alive]], ragdoll is active - [[true]]
  * {{GVI|arma3|2.10|size= 0.75}} Unit is NOT [[alive]], ragdoll is NOT active - [[false]]

  {{GVI|arma3|2.10|size= 0.75}} Here is a simple formula to return ragdoll state of a unit:
  <sqf>private _unitIsInRagdoll = alive _unit != isAwake _unit;
