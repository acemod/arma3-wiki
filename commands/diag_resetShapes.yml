description: |-
  Reload models on-the-fly without the need of restarting the game.
  Changes applied by '''diag_resetShapes''' are applied to all new entities so restart of mission is not necessarily  required - spawning vehicle again or changing back forth weapon should usually do the trick.
  It works only with {{hl|[[Arma 3: Startup Parameters#Developer Options|-filePatching]]}} in combination with local data. Command will reload '''only''' models present in local data.
  {{Feature|informative|Limitation: {{hl|CfgSkeletons}} (inside {{hl|model.cfg}}) cannot be reloaded.}}
