name: respawnVehicle
desc: |-
  Sets vehicle as respawnable in MP game (see [[Vehicle Respawn]]). The vehicle will be spawned at the locality and coordinates it was prior to destruction.
  If respawn type is set to base respawn (type 3) and vehicle respawn marker is provided (respawn_vehicle_SIDEXXX), vehicle will spawn on the marker. The command must be executed where vehicle is [[local]]. If the vehicle is in respawn queue, as long as the vehicle is [[local]] it should be possible to update params of the respawning vehicle, i.e change delay, disable respawn, etc.
