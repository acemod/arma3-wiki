  Returns an array of config entries which meet criteria in condition code. Command iterates through available classes and config properties for given config entry.
  Current looked at config is stored in _x variable (similar to alternative [[count]] command implementation).
  Condition has to return [[true]] in order for the looked at property to be added to the resulting array. This command is a bit slower than [[configClasses]] but allows to access inherited entries.
