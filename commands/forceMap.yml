name: forceMap
desc: |-
  Opens non-interactive main map in background that overrides user screen. To force open interactive map use [[openMap]] command.
  {{Feature|warning|
  When the map is forced open with this command, the user is still able to fire but cannot see the world, just the map.
  The map cannot be closed manually and the user can get stuck requiring a game restart. Make sure you provide scripted mechanics to de-force the map at a later stage.
