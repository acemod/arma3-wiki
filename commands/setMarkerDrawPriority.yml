  {{Feature|important|Be aware that this command has '''local''' effect despite the command name missing the word '''local'''!}}
problem_notes:
- '[[setMarkerDrawPriority]] sorts [[allMapMarkers]] from least to most priority. Before {{GVI|arma3|2.18|size= 0.75}} [[createMarker]]/[[createMarkerLocal]] did ''''''not'''''' care about drawing priority and added the created marker to the end of the array, making it top priority. Running [[setMarkerDrawPriority]] again sorted this issue.'
