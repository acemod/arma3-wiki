  [[File:sphere_radius.jpg|right|200px]]
  Finds entities inside a sphere with the given radius. If the alternative syntax is used, only entities of given types or subtypes are listed.
  Entities returned are not sorted by distance.

  The main syntax does not return dead entities or entities inside vehicles. If you need to return those, use the {{Link|#Syntax 3|alternative syntax}} (with ''includeCrew'' set to [[true]]) or the [[entities]] command.

  {{Feature|informative|This command is [[Code Optimisation#nearEntities and nearestObjects|much faster]] than [[nearestObjects]] for on-foot soldier and vehicle detection.}}
