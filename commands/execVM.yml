name: execVM
desc: |-
  Compiles and adds an [[SQF Syntax|SQF]] [[Script Handle|script]] to the [[Scheduler|scheduler]] queue and returns script handle (see also {{Link|#Example 4}}).
  The script does not execute immediately upon running [[execVM]] command but with some delay depending on the VM's scripts queue and engine load.

  {{Feature|informative|
  * If the same script is to be executed more than one time, declaring it as a [[Arma 3: Functions Library|Function]] is recommended to avoid recompiling and wasting performance with every execution.
  * The script is searched for in the following directories in that order:
  ** mission directory
  ** campaign scripts directory
  ** global scripts directory.
  * To see what VM scripts are currently in the scheduler, use [[diag_activeSQFScripts]] command.
  }}

  {{Feature|important|
  * The {{hl|.sqf}} file extension is not mandatory but is strongly recommended as using non-standard extensions may cause problems during binarisation
  * If the script file is not prepared using UTF-8 encoding and contains some characters [[toArray|with codes]] > 127, they might convert incorrectly.

  <sqf>
  private _handle = _args execVM "someFile.sqf";
  // is practically identical to
