desc: |-
  Autosaves the game (used for Retry). The saving is not started immediately, the request for autosave is made instead. To check the status of the request, use [[isSaving]]. The game can then be loaded from the last autosave with [[loadGame]]. Will not save if the player is [[objNull | null]] or dead.
