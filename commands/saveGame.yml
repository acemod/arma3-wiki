name: saveGame
desc: |-
  Autosaves the game (used for Retry). The saving is not started immediately, the request for autosave is made instead. To check the status of the request, use [[isSaving]]. The game can then be loaded from the last autosave with [[loadGame]]. Will not save if the player is [[objNull | null]] or dead.
  {{Feature|arma3|Since {{GVI|arma3|1.88}} a {{hl|[[Arma 3: Scripted Event Handlers#Events | "OnSaveGame"]]}} [[BIS_fnc_addScriptedEventHandler | scripted event handler]] is available.}}
