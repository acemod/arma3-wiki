      has access to the following variables:
      * '''_id''': [[Number]] - is the unique DirectPlay ID. Quite useless as the number is too big for in-built string representation and gets rounded. It is also the same id used for user placed markers.
      * '''_uid''': [[String]] - is [[getPlayerUID]] of the joining player. In Arma 3 it is also the same as Steam ID.
      * '''_name''': [[String]] - is [[profileName]] of the joining player.
      * {{GVI|arma3|1.50}} '''_jip''': [[Boolean]] - is a flag that indicates whether or not the player joined after the mission has started ('''J'''oined '''I'''n '''P'''rogress). [[true]] when the player is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Join In Progress|JIP]], otherwise [[false]].
      * {{GVI|arma3|1.50}} '''_owner''': [[Number]] - is [[owner]] id of the joining player. Can be used for kick or ban purposes or just for [[publicVariableClient]].
      * {{GVI|arma3|1.96}} '''_idstr''': [[String]] - same as {{hl|_id}} but in string format, so could be exactly compared to [[allMapMarkers | user marker]] ids.
