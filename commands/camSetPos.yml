name: camSetPos
desc: |-
  Sets the position of the given camera or seagull (see [[camCreate]]).
  It is worth mentioning that camera position can also be set with [[setPos]], in which case it would be instant.
  With [[camSetPos]] it is possible to make smooth position transition in time, defined with [[camCommit]], which is required in this case.
