description: |-
  Sets the text label of an existing marker.
  {{Feature|informative|'''Multiplayer optimisation:''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''entire'' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}
