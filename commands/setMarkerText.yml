  Sets the text label of an existing marker.
  {{Feature|informative|
  '''Multiplayer optimisation:''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''entire'' marker state over the network.
  As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).
