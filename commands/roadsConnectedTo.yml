name: roadsConnectedTo
desc: |-
  Find the road segments connected to the given road segment.
  {{Feature|important|
  * Pedestrian roads such as {{hl|"TRAIL"}}s are missing connection information by design, therefore the primary syntax will return empty array for those - use the alternative syntax to return pedestrian roads.
  * Road connection is not bidirectional; e.g road segment Y can be connected to road segment Z, but road segment Z can lack a connection with road segment Y.
