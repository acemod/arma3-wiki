description: |-
  Magnitude of a 3D vector.<br>
  {{Feature|GVI|arma3|2.14|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}} any count of numbers is valid.<br>
  Before {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}}, the argument had to be vector 3D, or {{GVI|arma3|2.00|size= 0.75}} 2D (With z coordinate defaulted to 0)}}

- "<sqf>\n_speed = vectorMagnitude velocity player;\t\t\t\t// return velocity of player in m/s\n_speed = (vectorMagnitude velocity player) * 3.6;\t\t// return velocity of player in km/h\n_speed = (vectorMagnitude velocity player) * 2.23694;\t// return velocity of player in mph\n</sqf>"
