name: addMPEventHandler
description: |-
  Adds a multiplayer event handler (EH) to the given object and returns EH handle. See {{Link|:Category:Event Handlers|Event Handlers}}.
  {{Feature|important|A Multiplayer Event Handler is '''not''' saved in a save file and therefore will not be restored on load - use it accordingly.}}
multiplayer_note: |-
  Multiplayer EHs are added globally to every client and the server will fire on itself and every client upon event.
  The only exception is the '''MPRespawn''' EH that one only fires where the respawned unit is local. Make sure to check the EHs' locality in {{Link|:Category:Event Handlers|Event Handlers}} pages.
