name: disableCollisionWith
description: |-
  Disable collision between provided objects. The collision is always disabled for both objects in the arguments.
  {{Feature|important|
  * this command does not disable collision between PhysX objects
  * this command has to be executed where objects are [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]], and as long as they do not change locality, the effect of this command will be global:
  ** if the two objects are not local to the same computer, then it has to be executed on both computers to achieve the desired effect
  ** if one or both objects change locality, the command needs to be executed again on the new [[owner]]'s machine(s) to maintain the effect
  * the feature works by having an object registering a reference to the other object; this command stores such reference on both objects - see {{Link|#Example 3}}
