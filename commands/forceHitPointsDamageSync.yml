name: forceHitPointsDamageSync
desc: |-
  Synchronises hitpoints values and total damage across current network clients as well as JIP.
  Possible uses after executing script commands such as [[setHit]], [[setHitIndex]], [[setHitPointDamage]] or in conjunction with {{Link|Arma 3: Event Handlers#HandleDamage|HandleDamage}} event handler (see {{Link|#Example 2}}).
multiplayer_note: Static buildings synchronisation should be executed on the [[isServer|server]] as the server is the authority in building damage and you would want every client in MP to have the same level of damage as the server has.
