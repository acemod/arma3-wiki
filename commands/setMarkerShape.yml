multiplayer_note: '{{Feature|informative|''''''Multiplayer optimisation:'''''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''''entire'''' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}'
