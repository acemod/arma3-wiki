name: setMass
desc: Changes the mass of a PhysX object. When using the alternative syntax the mass change is gradual during the given time. A time of zero means immediate change.{{Feature | important | When main syntax is used on [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] vehicle, the change is global. When alternative syntax is used with time transition on [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] vehicle, the gradual mass change doesn't happen on remote clients, only final mass is applied after the given time. If you need gradual change on remote clients too, [[remoteExec | remote execute]] [[setMass]] globally. }}
