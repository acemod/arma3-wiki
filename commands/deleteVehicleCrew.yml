name: deleteVehicleCrew
description: |-
  Deletes a member of or the whole crew of a vehicle. Human players cannot be deleted.
  {{Feature|informative|This command attempts to move the given [[crew]] member out before deleting it. Made especially for deleting dead crew members, as using conventional [[deleteVehicle]] leads to all sorts of bugs and ghost objects. While the argument is global, you should take extra steps and execute this where vehicle is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] as moving units out of the vehicle happens where vehicle is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]] and you want this to always precede deletion.}}
