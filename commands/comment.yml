  Defines a comment. See {{Link|SQF Syntax#Comments}} to learn more about comments.
  {{Feature|warning|
  This command is evaluated during execution, and as such is infinitely slower than other SQF comment methods (<sqf inline>// comment</sqf> or <sqf inline>/* comment */</sqf>) which get preprocessed and do not exist at runtime).
  See [[SQF Syntax|SQF Syntax]] for additional documentation on comments.
  }}
  {{Feature|informative|
  This command is only used to place comments in unpreprocessed codes, such as trigger On Activation field, object init field, etc.
  Alternatively, one can use a plain string followed by a semicolon as a way to comment; e.g <sqf inline>"Some comment";</sqf>.

  In an object init field (in editor):
  <sqf>
  comment "This comment works";
  "This comment works too";
  // This doesn't work
  /* This doesn't work either */
