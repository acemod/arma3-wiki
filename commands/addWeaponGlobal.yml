name: addWeaponGlobal
description: |-
  Add a weapon to a unit. Infantry units can only carry weapons in their respective slots (primary, secondary and handgun),
  the [[addWeaponGlobal]] command will replace the weapon currently in a slot with the added weapon if it shares the same slot.
  This command can link items to respective slots as well, in which case the functionality is identical to [[linkItem]].

  To make sure the added weapon is loaded and ready, add the magazine first.
