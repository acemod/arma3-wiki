name: animateBay
description: |-
  Forces animation of bay to given state, -1 for reset to engine handling, can cause weapon inoperative, because weapon is released when bay state == 1.
  {{Feature|informative|
  While there is no getter to read the animation phase of the given bay, the [[animationPhase]] command can be used with the individual bay door name from [[animationNames]] as a workaround (See {{Link|#Example 3}}).
