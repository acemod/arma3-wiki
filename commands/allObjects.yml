      type can be a combination of types according to bit flag operation (see [[getObjectType]]):
      * -1 - {{GVI|arma3|2.12}} All types incl. nulls (nulls exist with 'objectCollection' 7 and 8)
      * 1 - Primary - normal object placed in Terrain Builder, part of landscape
      * 2 - Network - road placed in Terrain Builder, part of landscape
      * 4 - Temporary - temporary object (like vehicle tracks)
      * 8 - TypeVehicle - entity added by game
      * 16 - TypeTempVehicle - temporary entity
      * 32 - LandDecal - land decal
      For example if required objects are both TerrainBuilder-placed ('''1''') and dynamically placed ('''8''') the combination type will be  8&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''9'''
      {{Feature|informative|Use '''63''' (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;16&nbsp;+&nbsp;32) to return objects of all types (excl. nulls).}}
