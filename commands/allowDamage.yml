name: allowDamage
desc: |-
  Enables / disables an entity's ability to receive damage. This command does not prevent the entity from taking scripted damage from commands such as [[setDamage]], [[setHit]], [[setHitIndex]] or [[setHitPointDamage]].
  {{Feature|informative|This command only supports entities ({{hl|Entity}} is a [[Class Inheritance|child class]] of {{hl|Object}}, i.e. all entities are objects, but not all objects are entities). Consequently, there are objects that are not affected by this command, for example terrain vegetation such as trees.}}
alias:
- '[[allowDammage]]'
multiplayer_note: '{{Feature | important | This command has to be executed where the object is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]]. Its effect will only last as long as the object does not change locality. If the object changes locality, the command needs to be executed again on the new [[owner]]''s machine to maintain the effect.}}'
