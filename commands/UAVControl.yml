  Since {{GVI|arma3|1.96|size= 0.75}} this command returns both driver and gunner units if the UAV is controlled by 2 players. Here is the list of all expected outputs:
  <sqf>
  [player1, "DRIVER"] // player1 is controlling the UAV and is the pilot
  [player2, "GUNNER"] // player2 is controlling the UAV and is the gunner
  [player1, "DRIVER", player2, "GUNNER"] // player1 is controlling the UAV as the pilot, player2 is controlling the UAV as the gunner
  [player3, ""] // no one is controlling the UAV, player3 is connected to the UAV via terminal, but not controlling it yet
  [objNull, ""] // nobody is controlling or connected to the UAV
