name: camCreate
desc: |-
  Create a camera or a seagull object on the given position. The creation happens immediately and doesn't wait for [[camCommit]].<br>
  Among other commands, [[cameraEffect]] must be used to enter the camera's view and [[camDestroy]] to delete the created camera. See also [[:Category:Command Group: Camera Control|Camera Control]].
  {{Feature|important|
  * Other objects can be created this way, but vehicles created with [[camCreate]] cannot be entered
  * Any unit created with [[camCreate]] will remain static
  * Unlike [[createVehicle]], objects are created exactly at the given position, without consideration of the surrounding objects.

multiplayer_note: camCreated objects are only visible locally (meaning they are client-side effects).
