name: sizeOf
desc: |-
  Returns the diameter of bounding sphere of the object of given classname in meters. If you need to estimate the size of the object more precisely, use [[boundingBox]] or [[boundingBoxReal]].
  {{Feature | important | At least one object of the given classname has to be present in the current mission otherwise zero will be returned.}}
