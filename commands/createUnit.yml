  Create a unit of the provided [[:Category:CfgVehicles|CfgVehicles]] class.

  {{Feature|warning|
  The unit will not be created if the passed group does not exist (a.k.a [[grpNull]]);
  this can happen if [[createGroup]] fails because the '''group limit has been reached''' (see [[createGroup]] for respective game limits).

  {{Feature|arma1|
  {{GVI|ofp|1.34}} {{GVI|arma1|1.00}} This command could be bugged in {{ofp}} or {{arma1}}; an additional [[join]] may solve the problem.<br>
  However, some commands such as [[setUnitPos]] only work if run before the [[join]].

multiplayer_note: It is recommended to create the unit where the group is '''[[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]]''' - use [[remoteExec]] if needed.

  Creating a unit from a different side may lead to issues:
  <sqf>
  _grp = createGroup east;
  hint str side _grp; // EAST
  _ap = _grp createUnit ["C_man_p_beggar_F", position player, [], 0, "NONE"];
  hint str side _ap; // CIV, not EAST

  // workaround
  [_ap] joinSilent _grp;
  hint str side _ap; // EAST
  </sqf>
- "Reference the created unit through a global variable:\n<sqf>\n_myUnit = \"B_RangeMaster_F\" createUnit [position player, group player];\t\t// wrong - this syntax does not return a reference\n\n\"B_RangeMaster_F\" createUnit [position player, group player, \"myUnit = this\"];\t// correct - the unit is myUnit\n</sqf>"
