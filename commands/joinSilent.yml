name: joinSilent
desc: Join all units in the array to given group silently (without radio message). To have a group member leave a group, join him with the [[grpNull]] group (e.g. {{hl|[guy1] [[joinSilent]] [[grpNull]]}}), but '''beware''', as brand new group is created for the leaving unit and this could result in the number of groups in a mission growing out of control.
