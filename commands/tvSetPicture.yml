  {{Feature|informative|
  * Adding pictures to lists is very slow. In order to prevent the filling of the list to be slowed down, add the pictures in a '''scheduled''' environment - See {{Link|#Example 3}}.
  One drawback of this method is that sorting the entries is not easily possible.
  * If not all items have a picture but you still want them to be aligned at the front, use a [[Procedural Textures|Procedural Texture]] that is transparent {{hl|#(rgb,32,32,3)color(1,1,1,0)}}.
