  Sets picture to item selected by path. IDC means id of parent Tree View. Name is picture name. The picture is searched in the mission directory.
  {{Feature|informative|
  Adding pictures to lists is very slow. In order to prevent the filling of the list to be slowed down, add the pictures in a '''scheduled''' environment - See {{Link|#Example 3}}.
  One drawback of this method is that sorting the entries is not easily possible.
