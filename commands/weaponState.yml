name: weaponState
description: |-
  Returns the given or currently selected weapon state for unit or vehicle.
  With {{Link|#Syntax 2}}, if no optional arguments are present, currently selected weapon is queried.
  {{Feature|arma3|
  Since {{arma3}} v1.70 this command has been improved and extended:
  * A vehicle's weapon query doesn't need a weapon operator provided the weapon or muzzle is specified in optional param.<br>(keep in mind that by default a vehicle has no weapons selected)
  * Driver turret can now be accessed as well with turret path [-1].
  * Muzzle name is supported as well as weapon name. The command searches for weapon first, then if not found, muzzle is searched for.
