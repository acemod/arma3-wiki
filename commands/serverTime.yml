description: |-
  Returns the time since latest server (re)start in seconds.
  {{Feature|important|The time returned is different to the time returned by [[time]] and [[diag_tickTime]] commands on server.}}
  {{Feature|informative|
  Known issues before {{GVI|arma3|1.86|size= 0.75}}:
  both server and clients showed the same value when synced, but the only time it was not synced was on the server, right after server restart and only for the first 300 seconds. Client-side it was synced from the start.
  }}
multiplayer_note: |-
  * In singleplayer: {{GVI|arma3|2.18|size= 0.75}} returns the same value as [[diag_tickTime]], the time since game launch (returned 0 before v2.18)
  * In multiplayer: It is synced to all clients both at mission start and when a new client connects to it, and every 5 minutes. Synchronisation can be forced by executing the [[estimatedTimeLeft]] command.
