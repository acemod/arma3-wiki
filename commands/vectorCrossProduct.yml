name: vectorCrossProduct
description: "Cross product of two 3D vectors. \n<br>In layman's terms, if you have a polygon (surface) defined by 3 points, you can find a normal to it (just like terrain [[surfaceNormal]]). To invert direction of the normal, swap arguments around."

examples:
- _vector = [1,1,1] vectorCrossProduct [2,2,2];
- _vectorUp = [0,1,0] vectorCrossProduct [-1,0,0]; //[0,-0,1]
- _vectorSide = (vectorDir player) vectorCrossProduct (vectorUp player);
