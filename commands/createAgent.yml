name: createAgent
desc: |-
  Creates an agent of the given type. An agent does not have a group or leader or the standard soldier [[FSM]] associated with it - for instance, an enemy soldier spawned as an agent has limited AI and will do nothing when fired upon - which can be useful to limit the amount of AI processing being done in a mission with very large numbers of "AI". Animals are also commonly created as agents.
  {{Feature|informative|
  * Players assigned to an agent using [[selectPlayer]] will be able to control the agent, operate weapons and other actions, but will not be able to access their inventory using the gear screen.
  * To create objects of type {{hl|"Logic"}}, use [[createUnit]].
