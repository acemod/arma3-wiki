desc: |-
  Finish the mission. If the server is set to run persistent mission, [[failMission]] will not end the mission when last player gets kicked to the lobby. Use [[endMission]] to end the mission.

  The end type can be:
  * "CONTINUE" - this is default type, basically an alias to do nothing
  * "KILLED"
  * "LOSER"
  * "END1"
  * "END2"
  * "END3"
  * "END4"
  * "END5"
  * "END6"

  {{Feature|arma3|To maintain Arma 3 visual style, it is recommended to use [[BIS_fnc_endMission]] instead.}}
