name: say
description: |-
  Make unit say given sound. The sound is defined in [[Description.ext#CfgSounds|CfgSounds]].
  If the [[Object#Unit|unit]] is a [[Object#Person|person]], it will also perform the corresponding lipsync effect provided an appropriate [[Lip File Format|.lip file]] has been [[WaveToLip|created]] for this sound.

  * A dead or non-existent unit obviously cannot say anything.
  * If the camera is not within given range, title is not shown and the sound will not be heard.
  * See also [[playSound]] in order to play a sound wherever the [[cameraOn|camera/player]] is.

  {{Feature|informative|[[say]] will mimic either [[say2D]] or [[say3D]] depending on whether it is executed in a cutscene or in a game scene.}}
