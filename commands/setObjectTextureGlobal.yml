name: setObjectTextureGlobal
description: |-
  Set the texture of the given selection on all computers in a network session.
  {{Feature|informative|
  * Not all objects can be textured this way. To find out, run [[getObjectTextures]] command on an object. Empty array <sqf inline>[]</sqf> usually indicates it cannot be textured.
  * All textures must have a resolution of 2<sup>a</sup> &times; 2<sup>b</sup> (e.g. 16&times;16, 16&times;32, 64&times;256, 512&times;512, ...). The largest texture size supported by the RV engine is 4096&times;4096.
  * Supported formats: .pac, .paa, .jpg, .jpeg, .ogg, .ogv

multiplayer_note: The effect is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Join In Progress|JIP]] compatible.
problem_notes:
- If executed from an object's init field (which should not be done anyway for {{Icon|globalEffect|32}} commands), execution may happen too early and fail to broadcast over the network and to be [[Multiplayer Scripting#Join In Progress|JIP]] compatible.
