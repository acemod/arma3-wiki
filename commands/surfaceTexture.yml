  Same as [[surfaceType]], but returns texture path to ground texture as string.
  {{Feature|informative|The texture returned is of the ground, even if there is a road at that position. To get road texture use [[getRoadInfo]] command.}}

      When a number is provided (Z in 3D positions), it is ignored. When a boolean is provided, it defines whether the layer mask should be used. Using the layer mask is more accurate but slightly slower.
