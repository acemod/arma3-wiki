name: setMarkerPos
description: |-
  Moves the marker. If position is given in 3D format, {{hl|z}} coordinate is stored with the marker and will be used when marker is passed to commands like [[createVehicle]], [[createUnit]], [[createAgent]], [[createMine]], [[setVehiclePosition]] for example. When [[Object]] is used for position, its [[getPosWorld]] is used.
  {{Feature|informative|'''Multiplayer optimisation:''' Global marker commands always broadcast the ''entire'' marker state over the network. As such, the number of network messages exchanged when creating or editing a marker can be reduced by performing all but the last operation using local marker commands, then using a global marker command for the last change (and subsequent global broadcast of all changes applied to the marker).}}
