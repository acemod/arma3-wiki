name: ctrlSetFocus
description: |-
  Sets the input focus on given control.

  {{Feature|important|
  * [[ctrlSetFocus]] seems to only work on controls that accept any input from keyboard or mouse.
  * if [[ctrlSetFocus]] is used on a [[CT_CONTROLS_GROUP]] that contains an interactable control, that control will automatically be active.
  * if [[ctrlSetFocus]] is used on a [[CT_CONTROLS_GROUP]] in which there are no interactable controls, then [[ctrlSetFocus]] will do nothing.}}
