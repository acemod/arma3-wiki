name: setCaptive
desc: |-
  Mark a unit as captive. If unit is a vehicle, commander is marked. A captive unit:
  * is seen as belonging to the [[civilian]] [[Side]]
  * will not be fired upon
  * will still shoot at its real side's enemies
  * will make its killer earn/lose [[score]]/[[rating]] as usual
  * will not get its weapons removed (see [[removeAllWeapons]])
  * will not trigger "detected by" conditions for its original [[Side]].
  {{Feature|informative|The number used as status can be retrieved by [[captiveNum]] to keep track of the captivity status at a finer resolution (e.g. handcuffed, grouped, etc).}}
