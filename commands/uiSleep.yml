name: uiSleep
description: |-
  Suspend execution of script for given UI time. [[uiSleep]] is a sleep method to delay script execution where script time/simulation time is stopped.
  [[uiSleep]] is basically using the system time (uiTime more specifically) and not simulation time.
  So in the cases where [[sleep]] would get stuck indefinitely, [[uiSleep]] can still be used to effectively delay script execution for example in pause or in a mission briefing or an editor or when simulation is paused in general.
