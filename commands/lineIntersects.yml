name: lineIntersects
desc: |-
  Checks for object intersection with a virtual line between two positions. Since {{GVI|arma3|2.20|size= 0.75}}, there is an alternative syntax that does multiple checks in parallel, faster than multiple calls.
  {{Feature|informative|
  * Does not work under water.
  * Max hardcoded distance is 1000m.

  Alternative syntax to check intersections in parallel:
  <sqf>
  private _enemies = units opfor;
  private _enemyDataArray = _enemies apply { [eyePos player, aimPos _x, player, _x] };
  private _result = lineIntersects [_enemyDataArray];
  </sqf>
