name: setCruiseControl
desc: |-
  Limits or sets '''[[local]] [[player]]-controlled''' vehicle's speed through cruise control.

  {{Feature|informative|
  * this command only works on CarX, TankX, ShipX simulation vehicles
  * this command is implemented using a PID controller overwriting the vehicle's thrust/brakes input

  * the vehicle does not accelerate by itself
  * manually accelerating is required to move forward
  * accelerating beyond set speed limit is restricted by the PID controller
  * applying brakes does not disable Speed Limiter
  * behaviour:
  ** if the speed is over 120% the set limit, the vehicle will apply 100% of braking and limit acceleration to 0%
  ** if the speed is below 80% the set limit, the acceleration and braking are untouched
  ** between 80 and 120%, the PID controller limits the acceleration and applies brakes if required
  {{!}}
  * the vehicle accelerates by itself
  * manually accelerating is possible
  * accelerating above set speed limit is possible
  * applying brakes disables Cruise Control
  * behaviour:
  ** if the speed is over 120% the set limit, the vehicle will apply 100% of braking
  ** if the speed is below 80% the set limit, the vehicle will apply 100% of acceleration
  ** between 80 and 120%, the PID controller manages the speed
