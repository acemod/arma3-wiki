name: setWaypointStatements
description: |-
  The waypoint is done only when the condition is fulfilled. When the waypoint is done, the statement expression is executed.<br>
  Within the Condition & Statement code string:
  * [[Magic Variables#this_2|this]] refers to the group leader
  * [[Magic Variables#thisList|thisList]] refers to the group's units
  {{Feature | important | The '''Condition''' code is evaluated on the [[groupOwner|group owner]]'s machine. When condition returns [[true]], for some strange reason, the condition is evaluated one more time. The '''OnActivation''' code is executed '''[[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|globally]]''', a.k.a on every client! See [[Waypoints]].}}
