  Allows a vehicle to be towed by another. This loosens the towed vehicle's brakes and turns its steering wheels toward the towing vehicle.
  Supposed to be used together with a rope connecting both vehicles.
multiplayer_note: |-
  {{Feature|warning|
  If a [[player]] enters the towing vehicle, the towed one will try to change its locality to be local to that [[player]]. This might be problematic if there is another [[player]] already in the towed vehicle. It is recommended to not have anyone in the towed vehicle!
