name: createGuardedPoint
description: |-
  Adds a point guarded by the given side (scripted way of adding equivalent of "GUARDED BY" trigger in [[:Category:Eden Editor|Editor]]). A closest AI group in the given side with assigned "GUARD" waypoint will attempt to secure this guard point. The actual guarded position is determined via the following rules:
  * Given "position" is always considered. It could be [[Object]], [[Group]], [[Position#Introduction|Position2D]] or [[Position#Introduction|Position3D]]. In every case, z coordinate will be ignored and point will be placed on nearest surface.
  * If "objectMapID" is not negative, the position of the object with the given ID is used (Overrides "position"). -1 to ignore this argument. z of the object position will be intact.
  * If the given "vehicle" is valid, the position of the vehicle is extracted and guarded (Overrides both "position" and "objectMapID"). [[objNull]] to ignore. z of the vehicle position will be intact.
  To be used with "GUARD" [[setWaypointType|waypoint]].
  {{Feature|informative|To know how does the "GUARD" waypoint work, see [[Waypoint:Guard]].}}
