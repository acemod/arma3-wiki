name: landAt
description: |-
  Order an AI airplane to land at a given airport. '''ID''' is the number to identify which map airport you want the airplane to land at. See [[Arma: Airport IDs]] for more information. See also [[land]].
  {{Feature|arma3|
  * {{GVI|arma3|1.68|size= 0.75}} it is possible to also make the airplane land at a [[Arma 3: Dynamic Airport Configuration|dynamic airport]] [[object]] (e.g. aircraft carrier, makeshift runway...) – see {{Link|#Example 2}}
  * {{GVI|arma3|2.18|size= 0.75}} it is also possible to make a helicopter land at a specific helipad.
  }}
  {{Feature|informative| Since {{GVI|arma3|2.20|size= 0.75}} [[landAt]] command has been extended. Helicopter can now be landed not only on a helipad but also at arbitrary position, provided that it is empty and can accomodate the helicopter. In "Land" landing mode the helicopter lands permanently, while in "GetIn" and "GetOut" landing mode the helicopter performs a short touch down before going to the next waypoint. In order to make helicopter wait, the 'waitTime' param can be used. Landing mode "None" cancels both, the landing in progress and waiting in progress. <br> Waiting time is available with [[landAt]] getter variant. When helicopter is landing, the time shown is the set time for wating, however when helicopter is landed, this time start counting down to 0, after which helicopter will take off if it has a waypoint to go to. The AI pilot state can be monitored with [[getUnitState]] command. The helicopter has to be [[local]] to the machine executing the command. VTOL waiting time is not supported}}
