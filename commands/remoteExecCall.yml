name: remoteExecCall
desc: |-
  [[Scheduler|Unscheduled]] version of [[remoteExec]]. The only difference between [[remoteExec]] and [[remoteExecCall]] is that [[remoteExecCall]] will run '''functions''' in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]].
  {{Feature|important|
  The "Call" in [[remoteExecCall]] only means that the remote execution will take place in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]] and does '''not''' mean it will happen right away (see {{Link|#Example 3}}).}}
