description: |-
  [[Scheduler|Unscheduled]] version of [[remoteExec]]. The only difference between [[remoteExec]] and [[remoteExecCall]] is that [[remoteExecCall]] will run '''functions''' in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]].
  {{Feature|important|
  The "Call" in [[remoteExecCall]] only means that the remote execution will take place in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]] and does '''not''' mean it will happen right away (see {{Link|#Example 3}}).}}

    ** If the '''JIP''' parameter was [[false]] or an empty string, the return value is "".
    ** If the '''JIP''' parameter was [[true]] or a custom JIP ID, the JIP ID is returned.
    ** If the '''JIP''' parameter was an [[Object]], a [[Group]] or a [[netId]], the (corresponding) [[netId]] is returned.

      * [[Object]] - the order will be executed where the given object is [[Multiplayer Scripting#Locality|local]]

      ** ff the string is empty, it is interpreted as [[false]]
      ** ff the string is in format "[[Number]]:[[Number]]" (e.g. "0:0"), it is interpreted as a [[netId]] (see below)
      ** else the string is treated as a custom JIP ID and the [[remoteExec]] statement is added to the JIP queue, replacing statements that have the same JIP ID
      * [[Object]], [[Group]] or [[netId]] - the persistent execution of the [[remoteExec]] statement is attached to the given object or group.<br>When the object / group is deleted, the [[remoteExec]] statement is automatically removed from the JIP queue

      The '''JIP''' parameter can only be used if the '''targets''' parameter is 0 or a negative number.<br>
      See also [[#Example 3|Example 3]] on how to remove statements from the JIP queue.
