name: remoteExecCall
description: |-
  [[Scheduler|Unscheduled]] version of [[remoteExec]]. The only difference between [[remoteExec]] and [[remoteExecCall]] is that [[remoteExecCall]] will run '''functions''' in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]].
  {{Feature|important|
  The "Call" in [[remoteExecCall]] only means that the remote execution will take place in [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]] and does '''not''' mean it will happen right away (see {{Link|#Example 3}}).}}

examples:

- "[\"my message\"] remoteExec [\"BIS_fnc_infoText\"];\t\t// correct\n[\"my message\"] remoteExecCall [\"BIS_fnc_infoText\"];\t// wrong - BIS_fnc_infoText needs a scheduled environment, see its spawn need"
- "remoteExecCall [\"fnc1\"];\ncall fnc2;\t// fnc1 may or may not be executed after fnc2\n\ncall fnc1;\ncall fnc2;\t// fnc2 will be executed after fnc1"
