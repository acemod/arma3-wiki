name: nearestObjects
description: |-
  Returns a list of nearest objects of the given types to the given position or object, within the specified distance. If more than one object is found they will be ordered by proximity, the closest one will be first in the array. If an object is given as the center and the filter criteria applies to it, it will be the first result in the list. Alternatively, you can use [[nearObjects]] command, which doesn't sort results.
  <br><br>
  A list of ClassName types (e.g {{hl|Tank}}) can be found in [[:Category:CfgVehicles|CfgVehicles]].
  {{Feature | important | This command matches objects using [[isKindOf]] comparison instead of direct class name [[==]] comparison. As a result, if a class type is a parent, the search will return all objects that inherit from the parent as well as parent itself. This command also only finds objects that are '''[[entities]]'''. If you are looking for non-entity objects, see [[nearObjects]], [[nearestObject]].}}

  {{Feature | warning | Because of map object streaming, using [[nearestObjects]] or similar object finding commands over long distance from player camera may not find what you are looking for, as some objects might not exist at the time of command execution. Use [[nearestTerrainObjects]] instead. }}
