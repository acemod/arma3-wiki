description: |-
  Asks the server to execute the given function or script command on the given target machine(s).
  * Functions are executed in the [[Scheduler#Scheduled Environment|scheduled environment]]; suspension is allowed.
  * Script commands are executed in the [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]]; suspension is not allowed (see {{Link|#Example 7}}).

  Read [[Arma 3: Remote Execution]] for more information about remote execution, security features and JIP techniques.

  {{Feature|informative|[[remoteExec]]/[[remoteExecCall]] can be used in single player as well, as it is considered as player-hosted multiplayer.}}

  {{Feature|important|The direct execution of [[call]] or [[spawn]] via [[remoteExec]] (or [[remoteExecCall]]) should be avoided to prevent issues in cases where the remote execution of [[call]] or [[spawn]] is blocked by [[Arma 3: CfgRemoteExec|CfgRemoteExec]]. It is instead recommended to create a function to be itself remote-executed.}}
multiplayer_note: Remote executions are queued and are therefore executed in the same order on remote clients (see {{Link|#Example 8}}).

  Add statements to the JIP queue:
  <sqf>
  private _jipId = ["mission state: the car is broken"] remoteExec ["systemChat", 0, true]; // adds the hint to the JIP queue and returns the JIP queue order id
  waitUntil { canMove _car };
  remoteExec ["", _jipId]; // the systemChat order is removed from the JIP queue
  </sqf>

  <sqf>
  ["mission state: the car is broken"] remoteExec ["systemChat", 0, _queueObject];
  // ...
  remoteExec ["", _queueObject]; // the order attached to _queueObject is removed
  </sqf>

  <sqf>
  private _jipId = ["mission state: the car is broken"] remoteExec ["systemChat", 0, "MY_JIP_ID"]; // _jipId is actually "MY_JIP_ID" now

  Some more complex examples:

  ["Open", true] remoteExec ["BIS_fnc_arsenal", MyTargetPlayer];
  [MyCurator, [[MyObject1, MyObject2], false]] remoteExec ["addCuratorEditableObjects", 2];
- "A tricky example: executing <sqf inline>player setAmmo [primaryWeapon player, 1];</sqf> (on machines where the player is in MyGroup):\n<sqf>\n[player, [primaryWeapon player, 1]] remoteExec [\"setAmmo\", MyGroup];\t\t// WRONG: the local player object is used here!\n{ player setAmmo [primaryWeapon player, 1]; } remoteExec [\"call\", MyGroup];\t// CORRECT: the remote player object is used here\n"

  As said in the description: '''commands''' will be executed in an [[Scheduler#Unscheduled Environment|unscheduled environment]]
  <sqf>[{ sleep 1 }] remoteExec ["call"]; // will throw an error: it is forbidden to use sleep (or waitUntil, etc) in unscheduled environment
