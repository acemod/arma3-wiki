- "<sqf>\nsystemChat \"start\";\nprivate _condition = true;\n\nif (_condition) then\n{\n\tif (true) exitWith\n\t{\n\t\tsystemChat \"exiting if _condition scope\";\n\t};\n\tsystemChat \"never shown\";\n};\n\nsystemChat \"exiting #1 worked\";\n\nif (true) exitWith\n{\n\tsystemChat \"exiting the main scope = leaving the whole script\";\n};\n\nsystemChat \"never shown - the script has already ended\";\n</sqf>"
- "<sqf>\nfor \"_j\" from 1 to 10 do\n{\n\tsystemChat format [\"%1\", _j];\n\n\t// the for loop will cease and code execution will continue after the end of the loop\n\tif (_j == 5) exitWith\n\t{\n\t\tsystemChat \"5 is enough\";\n\t};\n};\nsystemChat \"Complete\";\n</sqf>"
- "Most loops will also terminate when their scope is exited. To exit and terminate scopes which are called every frame such as [[onEachFrame]] and [[waitUntil]] use the following examples:\n\n<sqf>\nonEachFrame {\n\tif (!alive player) exitWith\n\t{\n\t\tonEachFrame {};\n\t};\n};\n</sqf>\n\n<sqf>\n_time = time + 10;\nwaitUntil \n{\n\tif (time > _time) exitWith { true };\n\tfalse\n};\n</sqf>"
- "<sqf>\nwhile { true } do\n{\n\tif (alive player) then\n\t{\n\t\tif (time > 300) exitWith // [wrong] - it will only leave the \"if alive player\" scope, remaining in the \"while true\" loop forever\n\t\t{\n\t\t\thint \"exiting\";\n\t\t};\n\t};\n};\n</sqf>"
- "<sqf>\nif (_condition) exitWith\n{\n\thint \"reached\";\n};\n// else { hint \"not reached\" }; // [wrong] - using else does not work and makes no sense here\n</sqf>\n<sqf>\nif (_condition) exitWith\n{\n\thint \"reached\";\n};\nhint \"not reached\"; // [correct] - if _condition is met, the scope has already been exited by now\n</sqf>"
