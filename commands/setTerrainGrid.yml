    description: "for default landscapes the supported resolutions are: \n\n* '''50''' - smoothest, less lag\n* '''25''' - default in multiplayer\n* '''12.5''' - default in single player\n* '''6.25'''\n* '''3.125''' - bumpiest, higher lag\n{{Feature|informative|If unsupported resolution is selected, the nearest supported resolution is used instead. Higher number means less vertices are used for terrain rendering, making distant hills less smooth. Value 12.5 corresponds to selecting Terrain Detail Normal in Video options, 50 to Very Low, 3.125 to Very High. In older games like [[:Category:ArmA: Armed Assault|{{arma1}}]] terrain resolution is fixed, determined by the world created.}}"
