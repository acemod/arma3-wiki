name: attachTo
description: "Attaches an object to another object.\n* The offset is applied to the object center unless a memory point is provided, in which case the offset will be applied to the memory point position.\n* If no offset is specified, the current offset between the two objects will be used.\n\n{{Feature | Informative | \n* All direction commands, such as [[setDir]], [[setVectorDirAndUp]], etc. for an [[attachedObjects|attached object]] should be used '''relative''' to the reference object's direction (i.e. in model space), e.g <sqf inline>_attachedObj setDir 0</sqf> will make it face the same direction as the reference object, '''90''' face to the right, '''180''' face to the back, etc.<br>\n* Attached triggers only follow the direction of the object to which they are attached, not pitch or roll.}}"
multiplayer_note: Use <sqf inline>_attachedObj setPosWorld getPosWorld _attachedObj</sqf> after [[setDir]] to synchronise set direction over the network (see [[setDir|setDir's page]] for its MP behaviour).
