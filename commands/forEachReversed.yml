  This command lets you easily iterate through an array from last to first element without modifying the array itself with [[reverse]] or using [[for]] loop with negative [[step]].
  <sqf>
  // Will show numbers from 5 to 1 in the chat
  { systemChat str _x } forEachReversed [1,2,3,4,5];

  Can be useful to walk through array while also deleting items from it, which you couldn't do with [[forEach]] as easily:
  <sqf>
  private _array = [1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2];
  {
      if (_x == 2) then { _array deleteAt _forEachIndex };
  } forEachReversed _array;
  // _array will be [1,1,1,1] here
  </sqf>
  Won't work with [[forEach]] as you might expect it:
  <sqf>
  private _array = [1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2];
  {
      if (_x == 2) then { _array deleteAt _forEachIndex };
  } forEach _array;
  // _array will be [1,1,2,1,1,2] here
- |
  Deleting items from array with more complex condition than just comparison.
  <sqf>
  {
      if (!alive _x) then { _vehicles deleteAt _forEachIndex };
  } forEachReversed _vehicles;
