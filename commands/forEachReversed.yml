  This command lets you easily iterate through an array from last to first element without modifying the array itself with [[reverse]] or using [[for]] loop with negative [[step]].
  <sqf>
  // Will show numbers from 5 to 1 in the chat
  { systemChat str _x } forEachReversed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
- "Can be useful to walk through array while also deleting items from it, which you couldn't do with [[forEach]] as easily:\n<sqf>\nprivate _array = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2];\n{\n\tif (_x == 2) then { _array deleteAt _forEachIndex };\n} forEachReversed _array;\n// _array will be [1,1,1,1] here\n</sqf>\n\nWill not work with [[forEach]] as you might expect it:\n<sqf>\nprivate _array = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2];\n{\n\tif (_x == 2) then { _array deleteAt _forEachIndex };\n} forEach _array;\n// _array will be [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2] here\n"
- "Deleting items from array with more complex condition than just comparison.\n<sqf>\n{\n\tif (!alive _x) then { _vehicles deleteAt _forEachIndex };\n} forEachReversed _vehicles;\n"
