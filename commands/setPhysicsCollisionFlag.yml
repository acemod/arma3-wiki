name: setPhysicsCollisionFlag
description: |-
  Sets physics collision flags for PhysX and geometry LODs. Roadway LOD interactions remain.<br>
  For example, if collision is disabled for a house, it is now possible to walk through its walls but still possible to walk on its floors.
  {{Feature|informative|Use the [[allLODs]] command to check if an object has a roadway LOD (normally, if an object is intended to be walkable, it does have a roadway LOD).}}
