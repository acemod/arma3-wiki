name: setPhysicsCollisionFlag
description: |-
  Sets physics collision flags.
  {{Feature|important|This command only disables collision (PhysX and Geometry LODs). Roadway LOD interactions are not affected. For example, if collision is disabled for a house, it is still possible to walk on its floors, but you can walk through its walls. Use the [[allLODs]] command to check if an object has a roadway LOD (normally, if an object is intended to be walkable, it does have a roadway LOD)}}
