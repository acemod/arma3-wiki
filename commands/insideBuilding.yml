name: insideBuilding
desc: |-
  Returns how much a man is inside a building. The value is the same as normally returned by weapons/ammo sound controller "interior".
  It is possible to modify an individual object to use sound interior with [[enableAudioFeature]].

  {{Feature|informative|
  The sound is considered internal when the corresponding surface sound name starts with "int_".
  An object placed inside a building that does not have model {{hl|CfgSurfaces}}' {{sic|[[Config Properties Megalist#soundEviron|soundEviron]]}} parameter named this way would generate external sound inside the building, and [[insideBuilding]] on top of this object would return 0.
