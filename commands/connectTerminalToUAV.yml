name: connectTerminalToUAV
description: Connect person with UAV terminal to UAV unit. UAV Terminal item needs to be assigned to GPS slot. In MP the connection is handled [[local]]ly, therefore it is possible for multiple MP clients to connect to the same UAV. However, each UAV can only have one connection to a terminal per MP client, so if UAV is already connected to another terminal on the same MP client, this new connection will fail.
