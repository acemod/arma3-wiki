  Break script flow and go to given label (defined by '''#''' - '''NOT''' to be confused with [[SQF Syntax|SQF]]'s [[a_hash_b|hash sign]]!)
  {{Feature|warning|This command only works in [[SQS Syntax]].}}
  {{Feature|informative|Note that labels are not case sensitive and are searched for from the top of the script, so multiple occurrences of a label will only result in the topmost one ever being found.}}
