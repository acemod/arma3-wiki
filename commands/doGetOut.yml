name: doGetOut
desc: |-
  Orders one or multiple units to get out from the vehicle (silently). Same as [[commandGetOut]] with latter being shown via radio chat.
  <br><br>
  Notes:
  * Works for both AI and player entities
  * AI unit gets back in - unless is under player command or combined with other sqf commands ([[orderGetIn]] false, [[allowGetIn]] false or [[leaveVehicle]])
  * Ignores vehicle's lock state - unlike [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] and [[moveOut]]
  * AI waits for execution until vehicle has stopped/is no longer flying (unclear if any timeout exists for order to be discarded) - unlike [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] and [[moveOut]]
  * Plays the vehicle's position's get out animation (same as [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]]) - unlike [[moveOut]]
  * When execute for multiple units, it waits till the action is completed, before the next to take his turn (same as [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]]) - unlike [[moveOut]]
  * AI gets back into formation afterwards
  * Works only on alive units - unlike [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] (one after another) or [[moveOut]] (instantly)
  * Does not work on [[setUnconscious|unconscious]] - unless the AI is under player command. Unlike [[moveOut]] or [[Arma_3_Actions#Eject|action "Eject"]] (but one after another))
multiplayer_note: This command is only effective when used on local units. When used on a remote unit, this command will create radio dialogue on the machine the unit is local to, but the unit will not leave the vehicle.
