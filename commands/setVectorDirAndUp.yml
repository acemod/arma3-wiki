description: |-
  [[File:Vectordirandup.jpg|right|300px]] Sets orientation of an object.
  The command takes 2 vector arrays, one for [[vectorDir]] and one for [[vectorUp]].
  Default object orientation will always have [[vectorDir]] pointing forward (North) along Y axis and [[vectorUp]] pointing up along Z axis - [[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], as shown on the diagram below (see also [[BIS_fnc_transformVectorDirAndUp]]).<br>

  When attaching object to an object the axes are relative to the object that gets the attachment.
  If it is player object for example, then X goes from left to right, Y goes from back to front, and Z goes from down up.<br>

  The [[setDir]] command is incompatible with [[setVectorDirAndUp]] and should not be used together on the same object.
  Using [[setVectorDirAndUp]] alone should be sufficient for any orientation.

  To rotate _myObject on Z axis 90 degrees clockwise, change its [[vectorDir]] but leave [[vectorUp]] unchanged.

  To rotate _myObject on Y axis 90 degrees clockwise, change its [[vectorUp]] but leave [[vectorDir]] unchanged.

  To rotate _myObject on X axis 90 degrees (tilt forward), change both [[vectorDir]] and [[vectorUp]] accordingly.
