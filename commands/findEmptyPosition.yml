name: findEmptyPosition
description: |-
  Searches for an empty area around the specified position, starting from the ''center'' looking for an empty ''areaRadius'' and looks as far away as ''areaRadius'' + ''maxDistance''.
  This command ignores moving objects present within the search area. The search area can be preloaded with [[findEmptyPositionReady]] command.

  {{Feature|informative|
  This command does not work outside of [[worldSize|world dimensions]] and will always return the provided ''center''.
  Objects outside the world dimensions will not be considered in the detection either.
