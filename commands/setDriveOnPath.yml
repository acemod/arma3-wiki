name: setDriveOnPath
description: |-
  Sets the path to follow for AI driver. Note that [[unitReady]] will return [[true]] even if AI is still driving through the points.<br>
  Using any other ''move'' command (e.g <sqf inline>_vehicle move getPosATL _vehicle</sqf>) or [[doStop]] will stop the effect of this command.
  {{Feature|important|This command does '''not''' work if the vehicle doesn't have an [[useAISteeringComponent|AI steering component]] defined in its config, or if the component is disabled. Thus, it never works on air vehicles and boats which don't use steering components. Only land vehicles may be compatible. (cars, tanks, APCs, etc.)}}
  {{Feature|informative|For the command to work properly, the unit must either be an [[createAgent|agent]], or in the case of normal AI, have been stopped using [[doStop]].}}
