description: |-
  Dot product of two 3D vectors.<br>
  {{Feature|GVI|arma3|2.14|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}} any count of numbers is valid, but both arrays must be same length.<br>
  Before {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}}, the first argument had to be vector 3D, or {{GVI|arma3|2.00|size= 0.75}} 2D (With z coordinate defaulted to 0)}}
