name: openMap
desc: |-
  Opens or closes in-game map.
  {{Feature|warning|
  If {{hl|forced}} param is set to [[true]] and map is set to open, when the map is opened it cannot be closed manually and the user can get stuck requiring the game restart.
  Make sure you provide scripted mechanics to resolve this, should you need to force the map.
  Useful when you wish to keep user for example on respawn screen, where they could still interact with the map but cannot enter the game until the time is up.
