name: currentWaypoint
description: |-
  Returns the '''index''' of the current waypoint contrary to misleading name.

  To determine the validity of the index, compare it to the waypoints count.

  If all waypoints are completed, then the index is 1 greater than the last valid index.

  If there are no waypoints, then the index is 0.

  By default, a group has 1 waypoint at their starting position, which is considered completed and so the currentWaypoint is 1.
