name: currentWaypoint
description: |-
  Returns the ''index'' of the current waypoint ('''not''' the waypoint in [[Waypoint|Waypoint Array]] format).

  To determine the validity of the index, compare it to the waypoints count.

  If all waypoints are completed, then the index is 1 greater than the last valid index.

  If there are no waypoints, then the index is 0.

  By default, a group has one waypoint at their starting position, which is considered completed so the currentWaypoint is 1.
