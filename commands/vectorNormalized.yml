name: vectorNormalized
description: |-
  Returns normalized vector (unit vector, [[vectorMagnitude]] {{=}}{{=}} 1) of given vector. If given vector is 0 result is a 0 vector as well.<br>
  {{Feature|GVI|arma3|2.14|Since {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}} any count of numbers is valid.<br>
  Before {{GVI|arma3|2.14|size= 0.75}}, the first argument had to be vector 3D, or {{GVI|arma3|2.00|size= 0.75}} 2D (Which still returned 3D result, with z coordinate defaulted to 0)}}
