name: setJointDriveAngularVelocity
desc: |-
  {{Wiki|WIP}} Requires that a swing+twist or SLERP "drive" has been configured in [[attachChild]].
  Sets the joints target angular velocity (orientation relative to the joint's own orientation).
  The drive will then behave like a spring (springParameters are configured in the drive), trying to accelerate the child object to the desired velocity.
