examples:
- |-
  Set compass to oscillate every second within -90/+90 degrees:
  <sqf>setCompassOscillation [rad 90, 1, 1];</sqf>
- |-
  Change heading every 60 to 90 seconds:
  <sqf>setCompassOscillation [rad 180, 60, 90];</sqf>
- |-
  Make compass go crazy:
  <sqf>setCompassOscillation [rad 360, 0.1, 0.2];</sqf>
- |-
  Reset to default behaviour:
  <sqf>setCompassOscillation [-1, 0, 0];</sqf>
