  * {{GVI|arma3|1.26|size= 0.75}} create a group if one is needed (otherwise uses <sqf inline>group _vehicle</sqf>)
  * create a driver if the vehicle needs one (<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp" inline>hasDriver = 1;</syntaxhighlight> in config)
  * create [[allTurrets|all non-FFV turrets]] gunners (if the turret needs one - config {<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp" inline>hasGunner</syntaxhighlight> without <syntaxhighlight lang="cpp" inline>dontCreateAI</syntaxhighlight>)
  * create crew with '''[[rank]]s''' - with the driver as {{hl|"LIEUTENANT"}} and all turret units as {{hl|"SERGEANT"}}, unlike a crewed vehicle placed in [[:Category:Eden Editor|Eden Editor]] where all units are {{hl|"PRIVATE"}}.
