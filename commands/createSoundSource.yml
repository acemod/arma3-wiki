name: createSoundSource
description: |-
  Creates a sound source of the given type (type is the name of the subclass of [[ArmA:_CfgVehicles|CfgVehicles]] which is pointing to the sound defined in [[CfgSFX]]).
  The actual sound object created is of type {{hl|"#dynamicsound"}} and could be detected with [[allMissionObjects]].
  If the markers array contains several marker names, the position of a random one is used, otherwise, the given position is used.
  The sound source is placed inside a circle with this position as its center and placement as its radius. Some of the vanilla classes pre-configured in {{arma3}}:
  {{Columns|4|
  * {{hl|"Sound_Alarm"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_Alarm2"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_BattlefieldExplosions"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_BattlefieldFirefight"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_Fire"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_SmokeWreck1"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_SparklesWreck1"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_SparklesWreck2"}}
  * {{hl|"Sound_Stream"}}
  }}

  Since {{arma3}} v1.70 it is possible to define sounds for use with [[createSoundSource]] in [[Description.ext]].
  As mentioned earlier, the sounds needed for this command should be defined inside [[CfgVehicles]] class, which itself references [[CfgSFX]] class.
  If given class searched in main config and is not found, the search will continue in [[Description.ext|description.ext]] - see {{Link|#Example 3}}.<br>
  Note that the sound created by [[createSoundSource]] will always be looping.
multiplayer_note: When a [[CfgSFX]] sound definition contains more than 1 sound, there is no guarantee that the sound played will be the same on every PC in Multiplayer.
problem_notes:
- '{{Feature|important|For some unknown reason if at the moment of command execution the player is in first person view and is inside a vehicle, the sound created is greatly attenuated.}}'

      If any of the markers were given a Z coordinate with [[setMarkerPos]], the sound will also be created at the given Z coordinate
